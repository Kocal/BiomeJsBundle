Contributed by @togami2864\r\n- Add support of comments in `turbo.json`. Contributed by @Netail\r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n- Add `--graphql-linter-enabled` option, to control whether the linter should be enabled or not for GraphQL files. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n- The option `--max-diagnostics` now accept a `none` value, which lifts the limit of diagnostics shown. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- When a `--reporter` is provided, and it's different from the default one, the value provided by via `--max-diagnostics` is ignored and **the limit is lifted**. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n- `biome init` now generates a new config file with more options set.\r\n  This change intends to improve discoverability of the options and to set the more commonly used options to their default values.\r\n  Contributed by Conaclos\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- `biome lint --write` now takes `--only` and `--skip` into account ([#3470](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3470)). Contributed by Conaclos\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n- Add support for loading configuration from `.editorconfig` files ([#1724](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1724)). Contributed by @dyc3\r\n  Configuration supplied in `.editorconfig` will be overridden by the configuration in `biome.json`. Support is disabled by default and can be enabled by adding the following to your formatter configuration in `biome.json`:\r\n  ```json\r\n  {\r\n    \"formatter\": {\r\n      \"useEditorconfig\": true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Formatter\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Add parentheses for nullcoalescing in ternaries.\r\n\r\n  This change aligns on [Prettier 3.3.3](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#333).\r\n  This adds clarity to operator precedence.\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - foo ? bar ?? foo : baz;\r\n  + foo ? (bar ?? foo) : baz;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Keep the parentheses around `infer` declarations in type unions and type intersections ([#3419](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3419)). Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Keep parentheses around a `yield` expression inside a type assertion.\r\n\r\n  Previously, Biome removed parentheses around some expressions that require them inside a type assertion.\r\n  For example, in the following code, Biome now preserves the parentheses.\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  function* f() {\r\n    return <T>(yield 0);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Remove parentheses around expressions that don't need them inside a decorator.\r\n\r\n  Biome now matches Prettier in the following cases:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n    class {\r\n  -   @(decorator)\r\n  +   @decorator\r\n      method() {}\r\n    },\r\n    class {\r\n  -   @(decorator())\r\n  +   @decorator()\r\n      method() {}\r\n    },\r\n    class {\r\n      @(decorator?.())\r\n      method() {}\r\n    },\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Keep parentheses around objects preceded with a `@satisfies` comment.\r\n\r\n  In the following example, parentheses are no longer removed.\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  export const PROPS = /** @satisfies {Record<string, string>} */ ({\r\n    prop: 0,\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n### Linter\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n- Add support for GraphQL linting. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n- Add [nursery/noDynamicNamespaceImportAccess](https://biomejs.dev/linter/no-dynamic-namespace-import-access/). Contributed by @minht11\r\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) no longer reports a direct reference to an enum member ([#2974](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2974)).\r\n\r\n  In the following code, the `A` reference is no longer reported as an undeclared variable.\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  enum E {\r\n    A = 1,\r\n    B = A << 1,\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Add [nursery/noIrregularWhitespace](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-irregular-whitespace). Contributed by @michellocana\r\n- Implement `noIrreguluarWhitespace` for CSS. Contributed by @DerTimonius\r\n- Add [nursery/useTrimStartEnd](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-trim-start-end/). Contributed by @chansuke\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- [noInvalidUseBeforeDeclaration](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-invalid-use-before-declaration) now reports direct use of an enum member before its declaration.\r\n\r\n  In the following code, `A` is reported as use before its declaration.\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  enum E {\r\n    B = A << 1,\r\n    A = 1,\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention) now supports [unicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase) letters.\r\n\r\n  [unicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase) letters have a single case: they are neither uppercase nor lowercase.\r\n  Biome now accepts filenames in unicase.\r\n  For example, the filename `안녕하세요` is now accepted.\r\n\r\n  We still reject a name that mixes unicase characters with lowercase or uppercase characters.\r\n  For example, the filename `A안녕하세요` is rejected.\r\n\r\n  This change also fixes [#3353](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3353).\r\n  Filenames consisting only of numbers are now accepted.\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention) now supports Next.js/Nuxt/Astro dynamic routes ([#3465](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3465)).\r\n\r\n  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments), [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#renaming-index), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route), and [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#rest-parameters) support dynamic routes such as `[...slug].js` and `[[...slug]].js`.\r\n\r\n  Biome now recognizes this syntax. `slug` must contain only alphanumeric characters.\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [useExportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-export-type/) no longer report empty `export` ([#3535](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3535)).\r\n\r\n  An empty `export {}` allows you to force TypeScript to consider a file with no imports and exports as an EcmaScript module.\r\n  While `export type {}` is valid, it is more common to use `export {}`.\r\n  Users may find it confusing that the linter asks them to convert it to `export type {}`.\r\n  Also, a bundler should be able to remove `export {}` as well as `export type {}`.\r\n  So it is not so useful to report `export {}`.\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables/) now checks TypeScript declaration files.\r\n\r\n  This allows to report a type that is unused because it isn't exported.\r\n  Global declarations files (declarations files without exports and imports) are still ignored.\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Don't request alt text for elements hidden from assistive technologies ([#3316](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3316)). Contributed by @robintown\r\n- Fix [[#3149](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3149)] crashes that occurred when applying the `noUselessFragments` unsafe fixes in certain scenarios. Contributed by @unvalley\r\n- `noExcessiveNestedTestSuites`: Fix another edge case where the rule would alert on heavily nested zod schemas. Contributed by @dyc3\r\n\r\n- `noExtraNonNullAssertion` no longer reports a single non-null assertion enclosed in parentheses ([#3352](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3352)). Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- `useAdjacentOverloadSignatures` no longer reports a `#private` class member and a public class member that share the same name ([#3309](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3309)).\r\n\r\n  The following code is no longer reported:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  class C {\r\n    #f() {}\r\n    g() {}\r\n    f() {}\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) now accepts applying custom convention on abstract classes. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) no longer suggests an empty fix when a name doesn't match strict Pascal case ([#3561](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3561)).\r\n\r\n  Previously the following code led `useNamingConvention` to suggest an empty fix.\r\n  The rule no longer provides a fix for this case.\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  type AAb = any\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) no longer provides fixes for global TypeScript declaration files.\r\n\r\n  Global TypeScript declaration files have no epxorts and no imports.\r\n  All the declared types are available in all files of the project.\r\n  Thus, it is not safe to propose renaming only in the declaration file.\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n### Parser\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#3287](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3287) nested selectors with pseudo-classes. Contributed by @denbezrukov\r\n- Fix [#3349](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3349) allow CSS multiple ampersand support. Contributed by @denbezrukov\r\n```css\r\n.class {\r\n  && {\r\n    color: red;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Fix [#3410](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3410) by correctly parsing break statements containing keywords.\r\n  ```js\r\n  out: while (true) {\r\n    break out;\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Contributed by @ah-yu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in

Contributed by @togami2864\n- Add support of comments in `turbo.json`. Contributed by @Netail\n\n### CLI\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add `--graphql-linter-enabled` option, to control whether the linter should enabled or not for GraphQL files. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Add support for loading configuration from `.editorconfig` files ([#1724](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1724)). Contributed by @dyc3\n  Configuration supplied in `.editorconfig` will be overridden by the configuration in `biome.json`. Support is disabled by default and can be enabled by adding the following to your formatter configuration in `biome.json`:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"formatter\": {\n      \"useEditorconfig\": true\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Editors\n\n### Formatter\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n### Linter\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- [noInvalidUseBeforeDeclaration](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-invalid-use-before-declaration) now reports direct use of an enum member before its declaration.\n\n  In the following code, `A` is reported as use before its declaration.\n\n  ```ts\n  enum E {\n    B = A << 1,\n    A = 1,\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention) now supports [unicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase) letters.\n\n  [unicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase) letters have a single case: they are neither uppercase nor lowercase.\n  Biome now accepts filenames in unicase.\n  For example, the filename `안녕하세요` is now accepted.\n\n  We still reject a name that mixes unicase characters with lowercase or uppercase characters.\n  For example, the filename `A안녕하세요` is rejected.\n\n  This change also fixes [#3353](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3353).\n  Filenames consisting only of numbers are now accepted.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add support for GraphQL linting. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Don't request alt text for elements hidden from assistive technologies ([#3316](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3316)). Contributed by @robintown\n- Fix [[#3149](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3149)] crashes that occurred when applying the `noUselessFragments` unsafe fixes in certain scenarios. Contributed by @unvalley\n- `noExcessiveNestedTestSuites`: Fix another edge case where the rule would alert on heavily nested zod schemas. Contributed by @dyc3\n\n#### New rules\n\n- Add [nursery/noDynamicNamespaceImportAccess](https://biomejs.dev/linter/no-dynamic-namespace-import-access/). Contributed by @minht11\n\n\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) n longer report a direct reference to an enum member ([#2974](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2974)).\n\n  In the following code, the `A` reference is no longer reported as an undeclared variable.\n\n  ```ts\n  enum E {\n    A = 1,\n    B = A << 1,\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n### Parser\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#3287](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3287) nested selectors with pseudo-classes. Contributed by @denbezrukov\n- Fix [#3349](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3349) allow CSS multiple ampersand support. Contributed by @denbezrukov\n```css\n.class {\n  && {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n* feat(graphql_formatter): bootstrap GraphQL formatter by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3255\n* fix(graphql_parser): parse object value in list by @vohoanglong0107 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3315\n* feat(graphql_formatter): implement BracketSpacing option by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3310\n* feat(graphql_formatter): format interfaces with comments by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3322\n* chore: fix typo in diagnostic comment by @polyomino24 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3321\n* feat(graphql_formatter): format StringValue #3319 by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3320\n* fix(deps): update rust crates by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3328\n* chore(deps): update rust crate serde_json to 1.0.119 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3327\n* chore(deps): update @biomejs packages by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3326\n* fix(deps): update dependency prettier to v3.3.2 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3329\n* chore(deps): update dependency dprint to v0.47.0 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3267\n* chore(deps): update pnpm to v9 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3331\n* feat(analyzer): expose a method to retrieve a service on demand by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3286\n* feat(editorconfig): reenable editorconfig support, add cli flag to disable it by @dyc3 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3246\n* fix(bench): better tracking for graphql benches by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3159\n* chore: translate README.md to Hindi by @harshrathod50 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3332\n* chore(deps): update github-actions by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3269\n* chore: revert some change in the READMEs by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3335\n* docs(governance): fix Discord link by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3336\n* feat(analyzer): update internal infra to account different rules  by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3275\n* test(editorconfig): additional tests for editorconfig support by @dyc3 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3219\n* chore(deps): update rust crate proc-macro2 to 1.0.86 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3268\n* chore(graphql_formatter): performance tests by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3323\n* feat: support eslint config .eslintrc on migrate by @ArvinQi in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3342\n* refactor(js_semantic): use u32 for scope id by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3358\n* feat(graphql_analyze): noDuplicatedFields by @vohoanglong0107 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3308\n* chore(deps): update rust crate serde_json to 1.0.120 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3376\n* chore(deps): update rust crate serde to 1.0.204 -

Contributed by @SuperchupuDev\n\n- Force colors to be off when using the GitHub reporter to properly create annotations in GitHub actions ([#3148](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3148)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Parser\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Implement [CSS unicode range](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3251). Contributed by @denbezrukov\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#3184](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3184) CSS formatter converts custom identifiers to lowercase. Contributed by @denbezrukov\n- Fix [#3256](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3256) constant crashes when editing css files #3256. Contributed by @denbezrukov\n\n### Linter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add `nursery/useDeprecatedReason` rule. Contributed by @vohoanglong0107.\n- Add [nursery/noExportedImports](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-exported-imports/). Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- `useConsistentArrayType` and `useShorthandArrayType` now ignore `Array` in the `extends` and `implements` clauses. Fix [#3247](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3247). Contributed by @Conaclos\n- Fixes [#3066](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3066) by taking into account the dependencies declared in the `package.json`. Contributed by @ematipico\n- The code action of the `useArrowFunction` rule now preserves a trailing comma when there is only a single type parameter in the arrow function and JSX is enabled. Fixes [#3292](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3292). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n#### Enhancements\n- Enhance tailwind sorting lint rule [#1274](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1274) with variant support.\n\n  Every preconfigured variant is assigned a `weight` that concurs on establishing the output sorting order.\n  Since nesting variants on the same utility class is possible, the resulting `weight` is the Bitwise XOR of all the variants weight for that class.\n  Dynamic variants (e.g. `has-[.custom-class]`, `group-[:checked]`) are also supported and they take the `weight` of their base variant name the custom value attached (e.g. `has-[.custom-class]` takes `has` weight).\n  Arbitrary variants (e.g. `[&nth-child(2)]`) don't have a weight assigned and they are placed after every known variant.\n  Classes with the same amount of arbitrary variants follow lexicographical order. The class that has the highest number of nested arbitrary variants is placed last.\n  Screen variants (e.g. `sm:`, `max-md:`, `min-lg:`) are not supported yet.\n\n  Contributed by @lutaok\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n* feat(workspace): adds GraphQL parsing capabilities via feature by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3238\n* feat(editorconfig): expand unknown globs into known globs by @dyc3 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3218\n* chore(core): implement `pull_diagnostics` for graphql by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3248\n* chore(linter): add a rule source of `noUnknownProperty` by @togami2864 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3252\n* feat: tailwind variant sorting by @lutaok in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3208\n* test(parse/json): add test for bug where overrides erroneously override special parsing options by @dyc3 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3260\n* docs(analyzer): improve contributing guide for rules with multiple signals by @minht11 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3245\n* chore(lint): initialise `biome_graphql_analyze` by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3276\n* chore(deps): update @biomejs packages by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3266\n* docs(useNamingConvention): add examples and improve explanations by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3277\n* refactor(parse/json): change fields in `JsonParserSettings` to `Option` by @dyc3 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3272\n* feat(search-output-formatter): initialize search output formatter by @BackupMiles in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3258\n* chore(grit): implement node-like compilers + fixes by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3253\n* feat: enable linting for graphql by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3295\n* refactor(parse/css): change fields in `CssParserSettings` to `Option` by @dyc3 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3273\n* refactor: add variables to format strings directly by @hamirmahal in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3299\n* chore: update codegen to include GraphQL by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3301\n\n## New Contributors\n* @BackupMiles made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3258\n* @hamirmahal made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3299\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/cli/v1.8.2...cli/v1.8.3",

Contributed by @ematipico\n- Fix [#3179](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3179) where comma separators are not correctly removed after running `biome migrate` and thus choke the parser. Contributed by @Sec-ant\n- Fix [#3232](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3232) by correctly using the colors set by the user. Contributed by @ematipico\n#### Enhancement\n\n- Reword the reporter message `No fixes needed` to `No fixes applied`.\n\n  The former message is misleading when there're still errors or warnings in the files that should be taken care of manually. For example:\n\n  ```block\n  Checked 2 files in <TIME>. No fixes needed.\n  Found 2 errors.\n  ```\n\n  The new message suits better in these cases.\n\n  Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Don't conceal previous overrides ([#3176](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3176)).\n\n  Previously, each override inherited the unset configuration of the base configuration.\n  This means that setting a configuration in an override can be concealed by a subsequent override that inherits of the value from the base configuration.\n\n  For example, in the next example, `noDebugger` was disabled for the `index.js` file.\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"linter\": {\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"suspicious\": { \"noDebugger\": \"off\" }\n      }\n    },\n    \"overrides\": [\n      {\n        \"include\": [\"index.js\"],\n        \"linter\": {\n          \"rules\": {\n            \"suspicious\": { \"noDebugger\": \"warn\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }, {\n        \"include\": [\"index.js\"],\n        \"linter\": {\n          \"rules\": {\n            \"suspicious\": { \"noDoubleEquals\": \"off\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The rule is now correctly enabled for the `index.js` file.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#3103](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3103) by correctly resolving CSS formatter options. Contributed by @ah-yu\n- Fix [#3192](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3192) don't add an extra whitespace within :has. Contributed by @denbezrukov\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix a regression introduced by the release of `v1.8.0`\n\n### Linter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add [nursery/useValidAutocomplete](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-valid-autocomplete/). Contributed by @unvalley\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Add [nursery/noShorthandPropertyOverrides](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-shorthand-property-overrides). [#2958](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2958) Contributed by @neokidev\n- Fix [[#3084](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3084)] false positive by correctly recognize parenthesized return statement. Contributed by @unvalley\n- [useImportExtensions](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-extensions/) now suggests a correct fix for `import '.'` and `import './.'`. Contributed by @minht11\n- Fix [useDateNow](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-date-now/) false positive when new Date object has arguments `new Date(0).getTime()`. Contributed by @minht11.\n- The [`noUnmatchableAnbSelector`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unmatchable-anb-selector/) rule is now able to catch unmatchable `an+b` selectors like `0n+0` or `-0n+0`. Contributed by @Sec-ant.\n- The [`useHookAtTopLevel`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-hook-at-top-level/) rule now recognizes properties named as hooks like `foo.useFoo()`. Contributed by @ksnyder9801\n- Fix [#3092](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3092), prevent warning for `Custom properties (--*)`. Contributed by @chansuke\n- Fix a false positive in the [`useLiteralKeys`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-literal-keys/) rule. ([#3160](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3160))\n\n  This rule now ignores the following kind of computed member name:\n\n  ```js\n  const a = {\n    [`line1\n    line2`]: true,\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- The [noUnknownProperty](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unknown-property/) rule now ignores the `composes` property often used in css modules. [#3000](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3000) Contributed by @chansuke\n\n- Fix false positives of the [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/) rule.\n\n  The component itself is considered stable when it is used recursively inside a hook closure defined inside of it:\n\n  ```jsx\n  import { useMemo } from \"react\";\n\n  function MyRecursiveComponent() {\n    // MyRecursiveComponent is stable, we don't need to add it to the dependencies list.\n    const children = useMemo(() => <MyRecursiveComponent />, []);\n    return <div>{children}</div>;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Also, `export default function` and `export default class` are considered stable now because they can only appear at the top level of a module.\n\n  Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Fix missing `withDefaults` macro in vue files for globals variables. Contributed by @Shyam-Chen\n\n### Parser\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix CSS modules settings mapping. Contributed by @denbezrukov\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n* chore(ci): improve rules_check task by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3165\n* chore: change `js` code blocks containing JSX elements to `jsx` by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3168\n* feat(biome_js_analyzer): `noSubstr` by @chansuke in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3125\n* chore(deps): update rust crate tokio to 1.38.0 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3146\n* chore(grit): implement Grit snippet bindings by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3162\n* chore(deps): update @biomejs packages by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3145\n* feat(analyzer): `useSortedKeys` for JSON objects by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2412\n* docs(useImportType): add docs about TypeScript settings by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3171\n* docs(noUndeclaredDependencies,useImportExtensions): add note about LSP configs by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3173\n* docs(no_undeclared_dependencies): follow up fix of #3173 by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3175\n* chore(ci): try enable `--compact` flag for `pkg.pr.new` by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3180\n* chore(ci): remove `--compact` flag by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3181\n* fix(formatter): escape double quotes when printing formatter IR by @dyc3 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3036\n* fix: remove unnecessary example by @lanker in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3185\n* chore: move maintainers to past maintainers by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3189\n* chore: removes old files by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3188\n* chore: move Sec-ant to core contributor by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3190\n* chore: add minht11 to the maintainers team by @minht11 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3191\n* chore: add `chansuke` to maintainers list by @chansuke in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3206\n* chore: rust 1.79.0 by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3222\n* chore(deps): update github-actions by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3225\n* chore(deps): update @biomejs packages by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3224\n* chore(grit): improve snippet compiler by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3223\n* refactor(analyzer): use `enumflags2` by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3230\n* feat(biome_css_analyzer): implement function-linear-gradient-no-nonstandard-direction  by @mdm317 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2911\n* chore(deps): update dependency eslint to v9.5.0 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3227\n* fix(deps): update rust crates by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3226\n\n## New Contributors\n* @ksnyder9801 made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3140\n* @lanker made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3185\n* @aldahick made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/3239\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/cli/v1.8.1...cli/v1.8.2",

    "body": "### CLI\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#3069](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3069), prevent overwriting paths when using `--staged` or `--changed` options. Contributed by @unvalley\r\n- Fix a case where the file link inside a diagnostic wasn't correctly displayed inside a terminal run by VSCode. Contributed by @uncenter\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#3067](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3067), by assigning the correct default value to `indentWidth`. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n### Formatter\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- Fix the bug where whitespace after the & character in CSS nesting was incorrectly trimmed, ensuring proper targeting of child classes [#3061](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3061). Contributed by @denbezrukov\r\n- Fix [#3068](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3068) where the CSS formatter was inadvertently converting variable declarations and function calls to lowercase. Contributed by @denbezrukov\r\n- Fix the formatting of CSS grid layout properties. Contributed by @denbezrukov\r\n\r\n### Linter\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- The `noEmptyBlock` css lint rule now treats empty blocks containing comments as valid ones. Contributed by @Sec-ant\r\n\r\n- [useLiteralKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-literal-keys/) no longer reports quoted member names ([#3085](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3085)).\r\n\r\n  Previously [useLiteralKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-literal-keys/) reported quoted member names that can be unquoted.\r\n  For example, the rule suggested the following fix:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - const x = { \"prop\": 0 };\r\n  + const x = { prop: 0 };\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  This conflicted with the option [quoteProperties](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#javascriptformatterquoteproperties) of our formatter.\r\n\r\n  The rule now ignores quoted member names.\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [noEmptyInterface](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-empty-interface/) now ignores empty interfaces in ambient modules ([#3110](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3110)). Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables/) and [noUnusedFunctionParameters](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-function-parameters/) no longer report the parameters of a constructor type ([#3135](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3135)).\r\n\r\n  Previously, `arg` was reported as unused in a constructor type like:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  export type Classlike = new (arg: unknown) => string;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [noStringCaseMismatch](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-string-case-mismatch/) now ignores escape sequences ([#3134](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3134)).\r\n\r\n  The following code is no longer reported by the rule:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  s.toUpperCase() === \"\\u001b\";\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n### Parser\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n- Implemented CSS Unknown At-Rule parsing, allowing the parser to gracefully handle unsupported or unrecognized CSS at-rules. Contributed by @denbezrukov\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- Fix [#3055](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3055) CSS: Layout using named grid lines is now correctly parsed. Contributed by @denbezrukov\r\n- Fix [#3091](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3091). Allows the parser to handle nested style rules and at-rules properly, enhancing the parser's compatibility with the CSS Nesting Module.

This is\n  used for the lint rule `useExhaustiveDependencies`, which is now able to\n  suppress specific dependencies. Fixes #2509. Contributed by @arendjr\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Assume `Astro` object is always a global when processing `.astro` files. Contributed by @minht11\n- Assume Vue compiler macros are globals when processing `.vue` files. ([#2771](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2771)) Contributed by @dyc3\n\n### CLI\n\n#### New features\n\n- New `clean` command. Use this new command to clean after the `biome-logs` directory, and remove all the log files.\n\n  ```shell\n  biome clean\n  ```\n\n- Add two new options `--only` and `--skip` to the command `biome lint` ([#58](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/58)).\n\n  The `--only` option allows you to run a given rule or rule group,\n  For example, the following command runs only the `style/useNamingConvention` and `style/noInferrableTypes` rules.\n  If the rule is disabled in the configuration, then its severity level is set to `error` for a recommended rule or `warn` otherwise.\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --only=style/useNamingConvention --only=style/noInferrableTypes\n  ```\n\n  Passing a group does not change the severity level of the rules in the group.\n  All the disabled rules in the group will remain disabled.\n  To ensure that the group is run, the `recommended` field of the group is enabled.\n  The `nursery` group cannot be passed, as no rules are enabled by default in the nursery group.\n\n  The `--skip` option allows you to skip the execution of a given group or a given rule.\n  For example, the following command skips the `style` group and the `suspicious/noExplicitAny` rule.\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --skip=style --skip=suspicious/noExplicitAny\n  ```\n\n  You can also use `--only` and `--skip` together. `--skip` oevrrides `--only`.\n  The following command executes only the rules from the `style` group, but the `style/useNamingConvention` rule.\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --only=style --skip=style/useNamingConvention\n  ```\n\n  These options are compatible with other options such as `--write` (previously `--apply`), and `--reporter`.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add new command `biome clean`. Use this command to purge all the logs emitted by the Biome daemon. This command is really useful, because the Biome daemon tends\n  log many files and contents during its lifecycle. This means that if your editor is open for hours (or even days), the `biome-logs` folder could become quite heavy. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add support for formatting and linting CSS files from the CLI. These operations are **opt-in** for the time being.\n\n  If you don't have a configuration file, you can enable these features with `--css-formatter-enabled` and `--css-linter-enabled`:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome check --css-formatter-enabled=true --css-linter-enabled=true ./\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add new CLI options to control the CSS formatting. Check the [CLI reference page](https://biomejs.dev/reference/cli/) for more details. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add new options `--write`, `--fix` (alias of `--write`) and `--unsafe` to the command `biome lint` and `biome check`.\n  Add a new option `--fix` (alias of `--write`) to the command `biome format` and `biome migrate`.\n\n  ```shell\n  biome <lint|check> --<write|fix> [--unsafe]\n  biome format --<write|fix>\n  biome migrate --<write|fix>\n  ```\n\n  The `biome <lint|check> --<write|fix>` has the same behavior as `biome <lint|check> --apply`.\n  The `biome <lint|check> --<write|fix> --unsafe` has the same behavior as `biome <lint|check> --apply-unsafe`.\n  The `biome format --fix` has the same behavior as `biome format --write`.\n  The `biome migrate --fix` has the same behavior as `biome migrate --write`.\n\n  This change allows these commands to write modifications in the same options.\n  With this change, the `--apply` and `--apply-unsafe` options are deprecated.\n\n  Contributed by @unvalley\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Biome now executes commands (lint, format, check and ci) on the working directory by default. [#2266](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2266) Contributed by @unvalley\n\n  ```diff\n  - biome check .\n  + biome check    # You can run the command without the path\n  ```\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now tries to convert ESLint ignore patterns into Biome ignore patterns.\n\n  ESLint uses [gitignore patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).\n  Biome now tries to convert these patterns into Biome ignore patterns.\n\n  For example, the gitignore pattern `/src` is a relative path to the file in which it appears.\n  Biome now recognizes this and translates this pattern to `./src`.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now supports the `eslintIgnore` field in `package.json`.\n\n  ESLint allows the use of `package.json` as an ESLint configuration file.\n  ESLint supports two fields: `eslintConfig` and `eslintIgnore`.\n  Biome only supported the former. It now supports both.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now propagates NodeJS errors to the user.\n\n  This will help users to identify why Biome is unable to load some ESLint configurations.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add a new `--reporter` called `summary`. This reporter will print diagnostics in a different way, based on the tools (formatter, linter, etc.) that are executed.\n  Import sorting and formatter shows the name of the files that require formatting. Instead, the linter will group the number of rules triggered and the number of errors/warnings:\n\n  ```\n  Formatter ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  The following files needs to be formatted:\n  main.ts\n  index.ts\n\n  Organize Imports ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  The following files needs to have their imports sorted:\n  main.ts\n  index.ts\n\n  Analyzer ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  Some analyzer rules were triggered\n\n  Rule Name                                               Diagnostics\n  lint/suspicious/noImplicitAnyLet                        12 (12 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals                          8 (8 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noRedeclare                             12 (12 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noDebugger                              20 (20 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- `biome ci` now enforces printing the output using colours. If you were previously using `--colors=force`, you can remove it because it's automatically set. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add a new `--reporter` called `github`. This reporter will print diagnostics using [GitHub workflow commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#about-workflow-commands):\n\n  ```\n  ::error title=lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals,file=main.ts,line=4,endLine=4,col=3,endColumn=5::Use === instead of ==\n  ::error title=lint/suspicious/noDebugger,file=main.ts,line=6,endLine=6,col=1,endColumn=9::This is an unexpected use of the debugger statement.\n  ::error title=lint/nursery/noEvolvingAny,file=main.ts,line=8,endLine=8,col=5,endColumn=6::This variable's type is not allowed to evolve implicitly, leading to potential any types.\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add a new `--reporter` called `junit`. This reporter will print diagnostics using [GitHub workflow commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#about-workflow-commands):\n\n  ```xml\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n  <testsuites name=\"Biome\" tests=\"16\" failures=\"16\" errors=\"20\" time=\"<TIME>\">\n    <testsuite name=\"main.ts\" tests=\"1\" disabled=\"0\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"1\" package=\"org.biome\">\n        <testcase name=\"org.biome.lint.suspicious.noDoubleEquals\" line=\"4\" column=\"3\">\n            <failure message=\"Use === instead of ==. == is only allowed when comparing against `null`\">line 3, col 2, Use === instead of ==. == is only allowed when comparing against `null`</failure>\n        </testcase>\n    </testsuite>\n    <testsuite name=\"main.ts\" tests=\"1\" disabled=\"0\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"1\" package=\"org.biome\">\n        <testcase name=\"org.biome.lint.suspicious.noDebugger\" line=\"6\" column=\"1\">\n            <failure message=\"This is an unexpected use of the debugger statement.\">line 5, col 0, This is an unexpected use of the debugger statement.</failure>\n        </testcase>\n    </testsuite>\n    <testsuite name=\"main.ts\" tests=\"1\" disabled=\"0\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"1\" package=\"org.biome\">\n        <testcase name=\"org.biome.lint.nursery.noEvolvingAny\" line=\"8\" column=\"5\">\n            <failure message=\"This variable&apos;s type is not allowed to evolve implicitly, leading to potential any types.\">line 7, col 4, This variable&apos;s type is not allowed to evolve implicitly, leading to potential any types.</failure>\n        </testcase>\n    </testsuite>\n  </testsuites>\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix  [#3024](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3024), where running `biome init` would create `biome.json` even if `biome.jsonc` already exists.  Contributed by @minht11\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add an rule option `fix` to override the code fix kind of a rule ([#2882](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2882)).\n\n  A rule can provide a safe or an **unsafe** code **action**.\n  You can now tune the kind of code actions thanks to the `fix` option.\n  This rule option takes a value among:\n\n  - `none`: the rule no longer emits code actions.\n  - `safe`: the rule emits safe code action.\n  - `unsafe`: the rule emits unsafe code action.\n\n  The following configuration disables the code actions of `noUnusedVariables`, makes the emitted code actions of `style/useConst` and `style/useTemplate` unsafe and safe respectively.\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"linter\": {\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"correctness\": {\n          \"noUnusedVariables\": {\n            \"level\": \"error\",\n            \"fix\": \"none\"\n          },\n          \"style\": {\n            \"useConst\": {\n              \"level\": \"warn\",\n              \"fix\": \"unsafe\"\n            },\n            \"useTemplate\": {\n              \"level\": \"warn\",\n              \"fix\": \"safe\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add option `javascript.linter.enabled` to control the linter for JavaScript (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `json.linter.enabled` to control the linter for JSON (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `css.linter.enabled` to control the linter for CSS (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `css.formatter`, to control the formatter options for CSS (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- You can now change the severity of lint rules down to `\"info\"`. The `\"info\"` severity doesn't emit error codes, and it isn't affected by other options like `--error-on-warnings`:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"linter\": {\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"suspicious\": {\n          \"noDebugger\": \"info\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- The `javascript.formatter.trailingComma` option is deprecated and renamed to `javascript.formatter.trailingCommas`. The corresponding CLI option `--trailing-comma` is also deprecated and renamed to `--trailing-commas`. Details can be checked in [#2492](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2492). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix a bug where if the formatter was disabled at the language level, it could be erroneously enabled by an\n  override that did not specify the formatter section [#2924](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2924). Contributed by @dyc3\n- Fix [#2990](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2990), now Biome doesn't add a trailing comma when formatting `biome.json`. Contributed by @dyc3\n\n### Editors\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add support for LSP Workspaces\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- The LSP doesn't crash anymore when the configuration file contains errors. If the configuration contains errors, Biome now shows a pop-up to the user, and it will only parse files using the default configuration.\n  Formatting and linting is disabled until the configuration file is fixed. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixes [#2781](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2781), by correctly computing the configuration to apply to a specific file. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#2470](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2470) by avoid introducing linebreaks in single line string interpolations. Contributed by @ah-yu\n- Resolve deadlocks by narrowing the scope of locks. Contributed by @mechairoi\n- Fix [#2782](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2782) by computing the enabled rules by taking the override settings into consideration. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Fix [https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2877] by correctly handling line terminators in JSX string. Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n### Linter\n\n#### Promoted rules\n\nNew rules are incubated in the nursery group. Once stable, we promote them to a stable group. The following rules are promoted:\n\n- [useImportRestrictions](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-restrictions/)\n- [noNodejsModules](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-nodejs-modules/)\n- [useArrayLiterals](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-array-literals/)\n- [noConstantMathMinMaxClamp](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-constant-math-min-max-clamp/)\n- [noFlatMapIdentity](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-flat-map-identity/)\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add [nursery/useDateNow](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-date-now/). Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useErrorMessage](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use_error_message/). Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useThrowOnlyError](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use_throw_only_error/). Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useImportExtensions](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-extensions/). Contributed by @minht11\n\n- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) now supports an option to enforce custom conventions ([#1900](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1900)).\n\n  For example, you can enforce the use of a prefix for private class members:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n  \t\"linter\": {\n  \t\t\"rules\": {\n  \t\t\t\"style\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\"useNamingConvention\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\"level\": \"error\",\n  \t\t\t\t\t\"options\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\"conventions\": [\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"selector\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"kind\": \"classMember\",\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"modifiers\": [\"private\"]\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"match\": \"_(.*)\",\n                  \"formats\": [\"camelCase\"]\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t]\n  \t\t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t}\n  \t\t}\n  \t}\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Please, find more details in the [rule documentation](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/#options).\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add [nursery/useNumberToFixedDigitsArgument](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-number-to-fixed-digits-argument/).\n  Contributed by @minht11\n\n- Add [nursery/useThrowNewError](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-throw-new-error/).\n  Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useTopLevelRegex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-top-level-regex), which enforces defining regular expressions at the top level of a module. [#2148](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2148) Contributed by @dyc3.\n- Add [nursery/noCssEmptyBlock](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-css-empty-block). [#2513](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2513) Contributed by @togami2864\n- Add [nursery/noDuplicateAtImportRules](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-at-import-rules). [#2658](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2658) Contributed by @DerTimonius\n- Add [nursery/noDuplicateFontNames](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-font-names). [#2308](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2308) Contributed by @togami2864\n- Add [nursery/noDuplicateSelectorsKeyframeBlock](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-selectors-keyframe-block). [#2534](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2534) Contributed by @isnakode\n- Add [nursery/noImportantInKeyframe](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-important-in-keyframe). [#2542](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2542) Contributed by @isnakode\n- Add [nursery/noInvalidPositionAtImportRule](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-invalid-position-at-import-rule). [#2717](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2717) Contributed by @t-shiratori\n- Add [nursery/noUnknownFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unknown-function). [#2570](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2570) Contributed by @neokidev\n- Add [nursery/noUnknownMediaFeatureName](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unknown-media-feature-name). [#2751](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2751) Contributed by @Kazuhiro-Mimaki\n- Add [nursery/noUnknownProperty](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unknown-property). [#2755](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2755) Contributed by @chansuke\n- Add [nursery/noUnknownSelectorPseudoElement](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unknown-selector-pseudo-element). [#2655](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2655) Contributed by @keita-hino\n- Add [nursery/noUnknownUnit](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unknwon-unit). [#2535](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2535) Contributed by @neokidev\n- Add [nursery/noUnmatchableAnbSelector](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unmatchable-anb-selector).

[#2573](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2573) Contributed by @togami2864\n- Add [nursery/noYodaExpression](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-yoda-expression/). Contributed by @michellocana\n- Add [nursery/noUnusedFunctionParameters](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-function-parameters/) Contributed by @printfn\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Add a code action for [noConfusingVoidType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-confusing-void-type/) and improve the diagnostics.\n\n  The rule now suggests using `undefined` instead of `void` in confusing places.\n  The diagnosis is also clearer.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n- Improve code action for [nursery/noUselessUndefinedInitialization](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-undefined-initialization/) to handle comments.\n\n  The rule now places inline comments after the declaration statement, instead of removing them.\n  The code action is now safe to apply.\n\n  Contributed by @lutaok\n\n- Make [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/) report duplicate dependencies. Contributed by @tunamaguro\n\n- Rename `noEvolvingAny` into `noEvolvingTypes` ([#48](https://github.com/biomejs/website/issues/48)). Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) and [noUnusedImports](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-imports) now correctly handle import namespaces ([#2796](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2796)).\n\n  Previously, Biome bound unqualified type to import namespaces.\n  Import namespaces can only be used as qualified names in a type (ambient) context.\n\n  ```ts\n  // Unused import\n  import * as Ns1 from \"\";\n  // This doesn't reference the import namespace `Ns1`\n  type T1 = Ns1; // Undeclared variable `Ns1`\n\n  // Unused import\n  import type * as Ns2 from \"\";\n  // This doesn't reference the import namespace `Ns2`\n  type T2 = Ns2; // Undeclared variable `Ns2`\n\n  import type * as Ns3 from \"\";\n  // This references the import namespace because it is a qualified name.\n  type T3 = Ns3.Inner;\n  // This also references the import namespace.\n  export type { Ns3 }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) now correctly handle ambient computed member names ([#2975](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2975)).\n\n  A constant can be imported as a type and used in a computed member name of a member signature.\n  Previously, Biome was unable to bind the value imported as a type to the computed member name.\n\n  ```ts\n  import type { NAME } from \"./constants.js\";\n  type X = { [NAME]: number };\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) now ignores `this` in JSX components ([#2636](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2636)).\n\n  The rule no longer reports `this` as undeclared in following code.\n\n  ```jsx\n  import { Component } from 'react';\n\n  export class MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n      return <this.foo />\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @printfn and @Conaclos\n\n- `useJsxKeyInIterable` now handles more cases involving fragments. See the snippets below. Contributed by @dyc3\n```jsx\n// valid\n[].map((item) => {\n\treturn <>{item.condition ? <div key={item.id} /> : <div key={item.id}>foo</div>}</>;\n});\n\n// invalid\n[].map((item) => {\n\treturn <>{item.condition ? <div /> : <div>foo</div>}</>;\n});\n```\n- `noExcessiveNestedTestSuites` no longer erroneously alerts on `describe` calls that are not invoking the global `describe` function. [#2599](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2599) Contributed by @dyc3\n```js\n// now valid\nz.object({})\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('');\n```\n- `noEmptyBlockStatements` no longer reports empty constructors using typescript parameter properties. [#3005](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/3005) Contributed by @dyc3\n- `noEmptyBlockStatements` no longer reports empty private or protected constructors. Contributed by @dyc3\n\n- [noExportsInTest](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-exports-in-test/) rule no longer treats files with in-source testing as test files https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2859. Contributed by @ah-yu\n- [useSortedClasses](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-sorted-classes/) now keeps leading and trailing spaces when applying the code action inside template literals:\n\n  ```\n  i Unsafe fix: Sort the classes.\n\n    1 1 │   <>\n    2   │ - → <div·class={`${variable}·px-2·foo·p-4·bar`}/>\n      2 │ + → <div·class={`${variable}·foo·bar·p-4·px-2`}/>\n    3 3 │   \t<div class={`px-2 foo p-4 bar ${variable}`}/>\n    4 4 │   </>\n  ```\n- [noUndeclaredDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-dependencies/) is correctly triggered when running `biome ci`. Contributed by @ematipico\n- [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables/) no longer panics when a certain combination of characters is typed.

([#2771](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2771)) Contributed by @dyc3\n\n### CLI\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add a new option `--rule` to the command `biome lint` ([#58](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/58)).\n\n  This new option allows you to execute a single rule or a rule group.\n  This option is convenient to test a rule or apply the code fixes of a single rule.\n\n  For example, you can execute the `style/useNamingConvention` rule on the working directory:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --rule=style/useNamingConvention ./\n  ```\n\n  If the rule has a code action (autofix), you can use `--apply` to apply the fix:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --rule=style/useNamingConvention --apply ./\n  ```\n\n  The option takes the rule options in the Biome configuration file into account.\n  Only, the severity level of the rule is overridden by its default value,\n  i.e. `error` for a recommended rule or `warn` otherwise.\n\n  You can also run a group of rules:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --rule=suspicious src/main.js\n  ```\n\n  In this case, the severity level of a rule is not overridden.\n  Thus, the disabled rules stay disabled.\n  To ensure that the group is run, the `recommended` field of the group is turned on.\n  The `nursery` group cannot be passed because no rules are enabled in the nursery group by default.\n\n  The option is compatible with other options such as `--apply`, `--apply-unsafe` and `--reporter`.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add new command `biome clean`. Use this command to purge all the logs emitted by the Biome daemon. This command is really useful, because the Biome daemon tends\n  log many files and contents during its lifecycle. This means that if your editor is open for hours (or even days), the `biome-logs` folder could become quite heavy. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add support for formatting and linting CSS files from the CLI. These operations are **opt-in** for the time being.\n\n  If you don't have a configuration file, you can enable these features with `--css-formatter-enabled` and `--css-linter-enabled`:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome check --css-formatter-enabled=true --css-linter-enabled=true ./\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add new CLI options to control the CSS formatting. Check the [CLI reference page](https://biomejs.dev/reference/cli/) for more details. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add new options `--write`, `--fix` (alias of `--write`) and `--unsafe` to the command `biome lint` and `biome check`.\n  Add a new option `--fix` (alias of `--write`) to the command `biome format` and `biome migrate`.\n\n  ```shell\n  biome <lint|check> --<write|fix> [--unsafe]\n  biome format --<write|fix>\n  biome migrate --<write|fix>\n  ```\n\n  The `biome <lint|check> --<write|fix>` has the same behavior as `biome <lint|check> --apply`.\n  The `biome <lint|check> --<write|fix> --unsafe` has the same behavior as `biome <lint|check> --apply-unsafe`.\n  The `biome format --fix` has the same behavior as `biome format --write`.\n  The `biome migrate --fix` has the same behavior as `biome migrate --write`.\n\n  This change allows these commands to write modifications in the same options.\n  With this change, the `--apply` and `--apply-unsafe` options are deprecated.\n\n  Contributed by @unvalley\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Biome now executes commands (lint, format, check and ci) on the working directory by default. [#2266](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2266) Contributed by @unvalley\n\n  ```diff\n  - biome check .\n  + biome check    # You can run the command without the path\n  ```\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now tries to convert ESLint ignore patterns into Biome ignore patterns.\n\n  ESLint uses [gitignore patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).\n  Biome now tries to convert these patterns into Biome ignore patterns.\n\n  For example, the gitignore pattern `/src` is a relative path to the file in which it appears.\n  Biome now recognizes this and translates this pattern to `./src`.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now supports the `eslintIgnore` field in `package.json`.\n\n  ESLint allows the use of `package.json` as an ESLint configuration file.\n  ESLint supports two fields: `eslintConfig` and `eslintIgnore`.\n  Biome only supported the former. It now supports both.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now propagates NodeJS errors to the user.\n\n  This will help users to identify why Biome is unable to load some ESLint configurations.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add a new `--reporter` called `summary`. This reporter will print diagnostics in a different way, based on the tools (formatter, linter, etc.) that are executed.\n  Import sorting and formatter shows the name of the files that require formatting. Instead, the linter will group the number of rules triggered and the number of errors/warnings:\n\n  ```\n  Formatter ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  The following files needs to be formatted:\n  main.ts\n  index.ts\n\n  Organize Imports ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  The following files needs to have their imports sorted:\n  main.ts\n  index.ts\n\n  Analyzer ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  Some analyzer rules were triggered\n\n  Rule Name                                               Diagnostics\n  lint/suspicious/noImplicitAnyLet                        12 (12 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals                          8 (8 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noRedeclare                             12 (12 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noDebugger                              20 (20 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- `biome ci` now enforces printing the output using colours. If you were previously using `--colors=force`, you can remove it because it's automatically set. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add an rule option `fix` to override the code fix kind of a rule ([#2882](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2882)).\n\n  A rule can provide a safe or an **unsafe** code **action**.\n  You can now tune the kind of code actions thanks to the `fix` option.\n  This rule option takes a value among:\n\n  - `none`: the rule no longer emits code actions.\n  - `safe`: the rule emits safe code action.\n  - `unsafe`: the rule emits unsafe code action.\n\n  The following configuration disables the code actions of `noUnusedVariables`, makes the emitted code actions of `style/useConst` and `style/useTemplate` unsafe and safe respectively.\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"linter\": {\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"correctness\": {\n          \"noUnusedVariables\": {\n            \"level\": \"error\",\n            \"fix\": \"none\"\n          },\n          \"style\": {\n            \"useConst\": {\n              \"level\": \"warn\",\n              \"fix\": \"unsafe\"\n            },\n            \"useTemplate\": {\n              \"level\": \"warn\",\n              \"fix\": \"safe\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add option `javascript.linter.enabled` to control the linter for JavaScript (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `json.linter.enabled` to control the linter for JSON (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `css.linter.enabled` to control the linter for CSS (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `css.formatter`, to control the formatter options for CSS (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- The `javascript.formatter.trailingComma` option is deprecated and renamed to `javascript.formatter.trailingCommas`. The corresponding CLI option `--trailing-comma` is also deprecated and renamed to `--trailing-commas`. Details can be checked in [#2492](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2492). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Editors\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add support for LSP Workspaces\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixes [#2781](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2781), by correctly computing the configuration to apply to a specific file. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#2470](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2470) by avoid introducing linebreaks in single line string interpolations. Contributed by @ah-yu\n- Resolve deadlocks by narrowing the scope of locks. Contributed by @mechairoi\n- Fix [#2782](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2782) by computing the enabled rules by taking the override settings into consideration. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n### Linter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add [nursery/useThrowOnlyError](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use_throw_only_error/). Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useImportExtensions](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-extensions/). Contributed by @minht11\n\n- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) now supports an option to enforce custom conventions ([#1900](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1900)).\n\n  For example, you can enforce the use of a prefix for private class members:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n  \t\"linter\": {\n  \t\t\"rules\": {\n  \t\t\t\"style\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\"useNamingConvention\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\"level\": \"error\",\n  \t\t\t\t\t\"options\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\"conventions\": [\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"selector\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"kind\": \"classMember\",\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"modifiers\": [\"private\"]\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"match\": \"_(.*)\",\n                  \"formats\": [\"camelCase\"]\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t]\n  \t\t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t}\n  \t\t}\n  \t}\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Please, find more details in the [rule documentation](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/#options).\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add [nursery/useNumberToFixedDigitsArgument](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-number-to-fixed-digits-argument/).\n  Contributed by @minht11\n\n- Add [nursery/useThrowNewError](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-throw-new-error/).\n  Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useTopLevelRegex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-top-level-regex), which enforces defining regular expressions at the top level of a module.

([#2771](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2771)) Contributed by @dyc3\n\n### CLI\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add a new option `--rule` to the command `biome lint` ([#58](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/58)).\n\n  This new option allows you to execute a single rule or a rule group.\n  This option is convenient to test a rule or apply the code fixes of a single rule.\n\n  For example, you can execute the `style/useNamingConvention` rule on the working directory:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --rule=style/useNamingConvention ./\n  ```\n\n  If the rule has a code action (autofix), you can use `--apply` to apply the fix:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --rule=style/useNamingConvention --apply ./\n  ```\n\n  The option takes the rule options in the Biome configuration file into account.\n  Only, the severity level of the rule is overridden by its default value,\n  i.e. `error` for a recommended rule or `warn` otherwise.\n\n  You can also run a group of rules:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome lint --rule=suspicious src/main.js\n  ```\n\n  In this case, the severity level of a rule is not overridden.\n  Thus, the disabled rules stay disabled.\n  To ensure that the group is run, the `recommended` field of the group is turned on.\n  The `nursery` group cannot be passed because no rules are enabled in the nursery group by default.\n\n  The option is compatible with other options such as `--apply`, `--apply-unsafe` and `--reporter`.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add new command `biome clean`. Use this command to purge all the logs emitted by the Biome daemon. This command is really useful, because the Biome daemon tends\n  log many files and contents during its lifecycle. This means that if your editor is open for hours (or even days), the `biome-logs` folder could become quite heavy. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add support for formatting and linting CSS files from the CLI. These operations are **opt-in** for the time being.\n\n  If you don't have a configuration file, you can enable these features with `--css-formatter-enabled` and `--css-linter-enabled`:\n\n  ```shell\n  biome check --css-formatter-enabled=true --css-linter-enabled=true ./\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add new CLI options to control the CSS formatting. Check the [CLI reference page](https://biomejs.dev/reference/cli/) for more details. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add new options `--write`, `--fix` (alias of `--write`) and `--unsafe` to the command `biome lint` and `biome check`.\n  Add a new option `--fix` (alias of `--write`) to the command `biome format` and `biome migrate`.\n\n  ```shell\n  biome <lint|check> --<write|fix> [--unsafe]\n  biome format --<write|fix>\n  biome migrate --<write|fix>\n  ```\n\n  The `biome <lint|check> --<write|fix>` has the same behavior as `biome <lint|check> --apply`.\n  The `biome <lint|check> --<write|fix> --unsafe` has the same behavior as `biome <lint|check> --apply-unsafe`.\n  The `biome format --fix` has the same behavior as `biome format --write`.\n  The `biome migrate --fix` has the same behavior as `biome migrate --write`.\n\n  This change allows these commands to write modifications in the same options.\n  With this change, the `--apply` and `--apply-unsafe` options are deprecated.\n\n  Contributed by @unvalley\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Biome now executes commands (lint, format, check and ci) on the working directory by default. [#2266](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2266) Contributed by @unvalley\n\n  ```diff\n  - biome check .\n  + biome check    # You can run the command without the path\n  ```\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now tries to convert ESLint ignore patterns into Biome ignore patterns.\n\n  ESLint uses [gitignore patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).\n  Biome now tries to convert these patterns into Biome ignore patterns.\n\n  For example, the gitignore pattern `/src` is a relative path to the file in which it appears.\n  Biome now recognizes this and translates this pattern to `./src`.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now supports the `eslintIgnore` field in `package.json`.\n\n  ESLint allows the use of `package.json` as an ESLint configuration file.\n  ESLint supports two fields: `eslintConfig` and `eslintIgnore`.\n  Biome only supported the former. It now supports both.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- `biome migrate eslint` now propagates NodeJS errors to the user.\n\n  This will help users to identify why Biome is unable to load some ESLint configurations.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add a new `--reporter` called `summary`. This reporter will print diagnostics in a different way, based on the tools (formatter, linter, etc.) that are executed.\n  Import sorting and formatter shows the name of the files that require formatting. Instead, the linter will group the number of rules triggered and the number of errors/warnings:\n\n  ```\n  Formatter ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  The following files needs to be formatted:\n  main.ts\n  index.ts\n\n  Organize Imports ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  The following files needs to have their imports sorted:\n  main.ts\n  index.ts\n\n  Analyzer ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n  Some analyzer rules were triggered\n\n  Rule Name                                               Diagnostics\n  lint/suspicious/noImplicitAnyLet                        12 (12 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals                          8 (8 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noRedeclare                             12 (12 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  lint/suspicious/noDebugger                              20 (20 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s))\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- `biome ci` now enforces printing the output using colours. If you were previously using `--colors=force`, you can remove it because it's automatically set. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add an rule option `fix` to override the code fix kind of a rule ([#2882](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2882)).\n\n  A rule can provide a safe or an **unsafe** code **action**.\n  You can now tune the kind of code actions thanks to the `fix` option.\n  This rule option takes a value among:\n\n  - `none`: the rule no longer emits code actions.\n  - `safe`: the rule emits safe code action.\n  - `unsafe`: the rule emits unsafe code action.\n\n  The following configuration disables the code actions of `noUnusedVariables`, makes the emitted code actions of `style/useConst` and `style/useTemplate` unsafe and safe respectively.\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"linter\": {\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"correctness\": {\n          \"noUnusedVariables\": {\n            \"level\": \"error\",\n            \"fix\": \"none\"\n          },\n          \"style\": {\n            \"useConst\": {\n              \"level\": \"warn\",\n              \"fix\": \"unsafe\"\n            },\n            \"useTemplate\": {\n              \"level\": \"warn\",\n              \"fix\": \"safe\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add option `javascript.linter.enabled` to control the linter for JavaScript (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `json.linter.enabled` to control the linter for JSON (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `css.linter.enabled` to control the linter for CSS (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Add option `css.formatter`, to control the formatter options for CSS (and its super languages) files. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- The `javascript.formatter.trailingComma` option is deprecated and renamed to `javascript.formatter.trailingCommas`. The corresponding CLI option `--trailing-comma` is also deprecated and renamed to `--trailing-commas`. Details can be checked in [#2492](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2492). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Editors\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add support for LSP Workspaces\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixes [#2781](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2781), by correctly computing the configuration to apply to a specific file.

Contributed by @ah-yu\n- Resolve deadlocks by narrowing the scope of locks. Contributed by @mechairoi\n- Fix [#2782](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2782) by computing the enabled rules by taking the override settings into consideration. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n### Linter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add [nursery/useThrowOnlyError](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use_throw_only_error/). Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useImportExtensions](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-extensions/). Contributed by @minht11\n\n- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) now supports an option to enforce custom conventions ([#1900](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1900)).\n\n  For example, you can enforce the use of a prefix for private class members:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n  \t\"linter\": {\n  \t\t\"rules\": {\n  \t\t\t\"style\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\"useNamingConvention\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\"level\": \"error\",\n  \t\t\t\t\t\"options\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\"conventions\": [\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"selector\": {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"kind\": \"classMember\",\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"modifiers\": [\"private\"]\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"match\": \"_(.*)\",\n                  \"formats\": [\"camelCase\"]\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t]\n  \t\t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t}\n  \t\t}\n  \t}\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Please, find more details in the [rule documentation](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/#options).\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Add [nursery/useNumberToFixedDigitsArgument](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-number-to-fixed-digits-argument/).\n  Contributed by @minht11\n\n- Add [nursery/useThrowNewError](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-throw-new-error/).\n  Contributed by @minht11\n- Add [nursery/useTopLevelRegex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-top-level-regex), which enforces defining regular expressions at the top level of a module.

Contributed by @michellocana\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Add a code action for [noConfusingVoidType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-confusing-void-type/) and improve the diagnostics.\n\n  The rule now suggests using `undefined` instead of `void` in confusing places.\n  The diagnosis is also clearer.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) and [noUnusedImports](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-imports) now correctly handle import namespaces ([#2796](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2796)).\n\n  Previously, Biome bound unqualified type to import namespaces.\n  Import namespaces can only be used as qualified names in a type (ambient) context.\n\n  ```ts\n  // Unused import\n  import * as Ns1 from \"\";\n  // This doesn't reference the import namespace `Ns1`\n  type T1 = Ns1; // Undeclared variable `Ns1`\n\n  // Unused import\n  import type * as Ns2 from \"\";\n  // This doesn't reference the import namespace `Ns2`\n  type T2 = Ns2; // Undeclared variable `Ns2`\n\n  import type * as Ns3 from \"\";\n  // This references the import namespace because it is a qualified name.\n  type T3 = Ns3.Inner;\n  // This also references the import namespace.\n  export type { Ns3 }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) now ignores `this` in JSX components ([#2636](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2636)).\n\n  The rule no longer reports `this` as undeclared in following code.\n\n  ```jsx\n  import { Component } from 'react';\n\n  export class MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n      return <this.foo />\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @printfn and @Conaclos\n\n- `useJsxKeyInIterable` now handles more cases involving fragments. See the snippets below. Contributed by @dyc3\n```jsx\n// valid\n[].map((item) => {\n\treturn <>{item.condition ? <div key={item.id} /> : <div key={item.id}>foo</div>}</>;\n});\n\n// invalid\n[].map((item) => {\n\treturn <>{item.condition ? <div /> : <div>foo</div>}</>;\n});\n```\n- `noExcessiveNestedTestSuites` no longer erroneously alerts on `describe` calls that are not invoking the global `describe` function. [#2599](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2599) Contributed by @dyc3\n```js\n// now valid\nz.object({})\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('')\n  .describe('');\n```\n\n- [noExportsInTest](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-exports-in-test/) rule no longer treats files with in-source testing as test files https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2859. Contributed by @ah-yu\n- [useSortedClasses](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-sorted-classes/) now keeps leading and trailing spaces when applying the code action inside template literals:\n\n  ```\n  i Unsafe fix: Sort the classes.\n\n    1 1 │   <>\n    2   │ - → <div·class={`${variable}·px-2·foo·p-4·bar`}/>\n      2 │ + → <div·class={`${variable}·foo·bar·p-4·px-2`}/>\n    3 3 │   \t<div class={`px-2 foo p-4 bar ${variable}`}/>\n    4 4 │   </>\n  ```\n- [noUndeclaredDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-dependencies/) is correctly triggered when running `biome ci`. Contributed by @ematipico\n- [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables/) no longer panics when a certain combination of characters is typed. Contributed by @ematipico\n### Parser\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- `lang=\"tsx\"` is now supported in Vue Single File Components. [#2765](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2765) Contributed by @dyc3\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- The `const` modifier for type parameters is now accepted for TypeScript `new` signatures ([#2825](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2825)).\n\n  The following code is now correctly parsed:\n\n  ```ts\n  interface I {\n    new<const T>(x: T): T\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Some invalid TypeScript syntax caused the Biome parser to crash.\n\n  The following invalid syntax no longer causes the Biome parser to crash:\n\n  ```ts\n  declare using x: null;\n  declare qwait using x: null;\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n*

[#2566](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2566). Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n### Linter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add [nusery/noReactSpecificProps](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-react-specific-props/).\n  Contributed by @marvin-j97\n\n- Add [noUselessUndefinedInitialization](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-undefined-initialization/).\n  Contributed by @lutaok\n\n- Add [nusery/useArrayLiterals](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-array-literals/).\n  Contributed by @Kazuhiro-Mimaki\n\n- Add [nusery/useConsistentBuiltinInstatiation](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-consistent-builtin-instatiation/).\n  Contributed by @minht11\n\n- Add [nusery/useDefaultSwitchClause](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-default-switch-clause/).\n  Contributed by @michellocana\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- [noDuplicateJsonKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-json-keys/) no longer crashes when a JSON file contains an unterminated string ([#2357](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2357)).\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare/) now reports redeclarations of parameters in a functions body ([#2394](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2394)).\n\n  The rule was unable to detect redeclarations of a parameter or type parameter in the function body.\n  The following two redeclarations are now reported:\n\n  ```ts\n  function f<T>(a) {\n    type T = number; // redeclaration\n    const a = 0; // redeclaration\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare/) no longer reports overloads in object types ([#2608](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2608)).\n\n  The rule no longer report redeclarations in the following code:\n\n  ```ts\n  type Overloads = {\n    ({ a }: { a: number }): number,\n    ({ a }: { a: string }): string,\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare/) now merge default function export declarations and types ([#2372](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2372)).\n\n  The following code is no longer reported as a redeclaration:\n\n  ```ts\n  interface Foo {}\n  export default function Foo() {}\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/) no longer reports variable-only and type-only exports ([#2637](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2637)).\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noUnusedVariables] no longer crash Biome when encountering a malformed conditional type ([#1695](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1695)).\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [useConst](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-const/) now ignores a variable that is read before its assignment.\n\n  Previously, the rule reported the following example:\n\n  ```js\n  let x;\n  x; // read\n  x = 0; // write\n  ```\n\n  It is now correctly ignored.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [useShorthandFunctionType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-function-type/) now suggests correct code fixes when parentheses are required ([#2595](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2595)).\n\n  Previously, the rule didn't add parentheses when they were needed.\n  It now adds parentheses when the function signature is inside an array, a union, or an intersection.\n\n  ```diff\n  - type Union = { (): number } | string;\n  + type Union = (() => number) | string;\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/) now correctly escapes strings ([#2580](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2580)).\n\n  Previously, the rule didn't correctly escape characters preceded by an escaped character.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noMisplacedAssertion](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-misplaced-assertion/) now allow these matchers\n  \n  - `expect.any()`\n  - `expect.anything()`\n  - `expect.closeTo`\n  - `expect.arrayContaining`\n  - `expect.objectContaining`\n  - `expect.stringContaining`\n  - `expect.stringMatching`\n  - `expect.extend`\n  - `expect.addEqualityTesters`\n  - `expect.addSnapshotSerializer`\n\n  Contributed by @fujiyamaorange\n\n### Parser\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- The language parsers no longer panic on unterminated strings followed by a newline and a space ([#2606](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2606), [#2410](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2410)).\n\n  The following example is now parsed without making Biome panics:\n\n  ```\n  \"\n   \"\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n* build(xstask): remove deps `fs_extra` and `filetime` by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2562\n* docs: Add more useImportType examples to docs by @drwpow in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2307\n* chore: update schema definition by @Mayandev in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2567\n* fix(configuration_schema): rename some fields to camelCase in the `configuration_schema.json` by @ah-yu in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2568\n* fix: rename some fileds to camelCase in the `configuration_schema` by @ah-yu in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2569\n* feat(biome_css_analyzer): noUnknownUnit by @neokidev in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2535\n* chore: fix some typos in comments by @hardlydearly in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2579\n* refactor: foundations for LSP workspaces support by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2589\n* fix(lint/noRedundantAlt): rule source by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2609\n* feat(linter): Implement `useGenericFontNames` by @togami2864 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2573\n* chore: remove some website leftovers by @SuperchupuDev in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2617\n* refactor(deserialize): don't handle Option specifically by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2630\n* refactor: use TriviaPiece factory functions in more places by @minht11 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2632\n* feat(biome_css_analyzer): noUnknownFunction by @neokidev in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2570\n* fix(snippet): should emit only one diagnostic by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2650\n* chore: add infrastructure for Grit engine by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2586\n* docs: fix typos in biome_rowan batch mutation by @vohoanglong0107 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2653\n* chore: upgrade prettier and update snapshots by @ah-yu in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2502\n* build(deps): update by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2657\n\n## New Contributors\n* @Mayandev made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2567\n* @neokidev made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2535\n* @hardlydearly made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2579\n* @minht11 made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2540\n* @Kazuhiro-Mimaki made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2541\n* @michellocana made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2605\n* @Shyam-Chen made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2598\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/cli/v1.7.1...cli/v1.7.2",

Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- `useExhaustiveDependencies` no longer reports recursive calls as missing\n  dependencies ([#2361](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2361)).\n  Contributed by @arendjr\n\n- `useExhaustiveDependencies` correctly reports missing dependencies declared\n  using function declarations ([#2362](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2362)).\n  Contributed by @arendjr\n\n- Biome now can handle `.svelte` and `.vue` files with `CRLF` as the end-of-line sequence. Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- `noMisplacedAssertion` no longer reports method calls by `describe`, `test`, `it` objects (e.g. `test.each([])()`) ([#2443](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2443)). Contributed by @unvalley.\n\n- Biome now can handle `.vue` files with [generic components](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#generics) ([#2456](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2456)).\n  ```vue\n  <script generic=\"T extends Record<string, any>\" lang=\"ts\" setup>\n  //...\n  </script>\n  ```\n  Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Complete the well-known file lists for JSON-like files. Trailing commas are allowed in `.jsonc` files by default. Some well-known files like `tsconfig.json` and `.babelrc` don't use the `.jsonc` extension but still allow comments and trailing commas. While others, such as `.eslintrc.json`, only allow comments. Biome is able to identify these files and adjusts the `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` option accordingly to ensure they are correctly parsed.

Contributed by @mdm317\n\n### CLI\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add a command to migrate from ESLint\n\n  `biome migrate eslint` allows you to migrate an ESLint configuration to Biome.\n  The command supports [legacy ESLint configurations](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files) and [new flat ESLint configurations](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new).\n  Legacy ESLint configurations using the YAML format are not supported.\n\n  When loading a legacy ESLint configuration, Biome resolves the `extends` field.\n  It resolves both shared configurations and plugin presets!\n  To do this, it invokes _Node.js_.\n\n  Biome relies on the metadata of its rules to determine the [equivalent rule of an ESLint rule](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules-sources/).\n  A Biome rule is either inspired or roughly identical to an ESLint rules.\n  By default, inspired and nursery rules are excluded from the migration.\n  You can use the CLI flags `--include-inspired` and `--include-nursery` to migrate them as well.\n\n  Note that this is a best-effort approach.\n  You are not guaranteed to get the same behavior as ESLint.\n\n  Given the following ESLint configuration:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n        \"ignore_patterns\": [\"**/*.test.js\"],\n        \"globals\": { \"var2\": \"readonly\" },\n        \"rules\": {\n            \"eqeqeq\": \"error\"\n        },\n        \"overrides\": [{\n            \"files\": [\"lib/*.js\"],\n            \"rules\": {\n              \"default-param-last\": \"off\"\n            }\n        }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n  `biome migrate eslint --write` changes the Biome configuration as follows:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"linter\": {\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"recommended\": false,\n        \"suspicious\": {\n          \"noDoubleEquals\": \"error\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"javascript\": { \"globals\": [\"var2\"] },\n    \"overrides\": [{\n      \"include\": [\"lib/*.js\"],\n      \"linter\": {\n        \"rules\": {\n          \"style\": {\n            \"useDefaultParameterLast\": \"off\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Also, if the working directory contains `.eslintignore`, then Biome migrates the glob patterns.\n  Nested `.eslintignore` in subdirectories and negated glob patterns are not supported.\n\n  If you find any issue, please don't hesitate to report them.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Added two new options to customise the emitted output of the CLI: `--reporter=json` and `--reporter=json-pretty`. With `--reporter=json`, the diagnostics and the\n  summary will be printed in the **terminal** in JSON format. With `--reporter=json-pretty`, you can print the same information, but formatted using the same options of your configuration.\n\n  NOTE: the shape of the JSON is considered experimental, and the shape of the JSON might change in the future.\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Example of output when running `biome format` command</summary>\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"summary\": {\n      \"changed\": 0,\n      \"unchanged\": 1,\n      \"errors\": 1,\n      \"warnings\": 0,\n      \"skipped\": 0,\n      \"suggestedFixesSkipped\": 0,\n      \"diagnosticsNotPrinted\": 0\n    },\n    \"diagnostics\": [\n      {\n        \"category\": \"format\",\n        \"severity\": \"error\",\n        \"description\": \"Formatter would have printed the following content:\",\n        \"message\": [\n          {\n            \"elements\": [],\n            \"content\": \"Formatter would have printed the following content:\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"advices\": {\n          \"advices\": [\n            {\n              \"diff\": {\n                \"dictionary\": \"  statement();\\n\",\n                \"ops\": [\n                  { \"diffOp\": { \"delete\": { \"range\": [0, 2] } } },\n                  { \"diffOp\": { \"equal\": { \"range\": [2, 12] } } },\n                  { \"diffOp\": { \"delete\": { \"range\": [0, 2] } } },\n                  { \"diffOp\": { \"equal\": { \"range\": [12, 13] } } },\n                  { \"diffOp\": { \"delete\": { \"range\": [0, 2] } } },\n                  { \"diffOp\": { \"insert\": { \"range\": [13, 15] } } }\n                ]\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        \"verboseAdvices\": { \"advices\": [] },\n        \"location\": {\n          \"path\": { \"file\": \"format.js\" },\n          \"span\": null,\n          \"sourceCode\": null\n        },\n        \"tags\": [],\n        \"source\": null\n      }\n    ],\n    \"command\": \"format\"\n  }\n  ```\n  </details>\n\n- Added new `--staged` flag to the `check`, `format` and `lint` subcommands.\n\n  This new option allows users to apply the command _only_ to the files that are staged (the\n  ones that will be committed), which can be very useful to simplify writing git hook scripts\n  such as `pre-commit`. Contributed by @castarco\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Improve support of `.prettierignore` when migrating from Prettier\n\n  Now, Biome translates most of the glob patterns in `.prettierignore` to the equivalent Biome ignore pattern.\n  Only negated glob patterns are not supported.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Support JavaScript configuration files when migrating from Prettier\n\n  `biome migrate prettier` is now able to migrate Prettier configuration files\n  ending with `js`, `mjs`, or `cjs` extensions.\n  To do this, Biome invokes Node.js.\n\n  Also, embedded Prettier configurations in `package.json` are now supported.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Support `overrides` field in Prettier configuration files when migrating from Prettier.\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Support passing a file path to the `--config-path` flag or the `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.\n\n  Now you can pass a `.json`/`.jsonc` file path with any filename to the `--config-path` flag or the\n  `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. This will disable the configuration auto-resolution and Biome\n  will try to read the configuration from the said file path ([#2265](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2265)).\n\n  ```shell\n  biome format --config-path=../biome.json ./src\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Biome now tags the diagnostics emitted by `organizeImports` and `formatter` with correct severity levels, so they will be properly filtered by the flag `--diagnostic-level` ([#2288](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2288)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Biome now correctly filters out files that are not present in the current directory when using the `--changed` flag [#1996](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1996). Contributed by @castarco\n\n- Biome now skips traversing `fifo` or `socket` files ([#2311](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2311)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Biome now resolves configuration files exported from external libraries in `extends` from the working directory (CLI) or project root (LSP). This is the documented behavior and previous resolution behavior is considered as a bug ([#2231](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2231)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Now setting group level `all` to `false` can disable recommended rules from that group when top level `recommended` is `true` or unset. Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Biome configuration files can correctly extends `.jsonc` configuration files now ([#2279](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2279)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Fixed the JSON schema for React hooks configuration ([#2396](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2396)). Contributed by @arendjr\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Biome now displays the location of a parsing error for its configuration file ([#1627](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1627)).\n\n  Previously, when Biome encountered a parsing error in its configuration file,\n  it didn't indicate the location of the error.\n  It now displays the name of the configuration file and the range where the error occurred.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- `options` is no longer required for rules without any options ([#2313](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2313)).\n\n  Previously, the JSON schema required to set `options` to `null` when an object is used to set the diagnostic level of a rule without any option.\n  However, if `options` is set to `null`, Biome emits an error.\n\n  The schema is now fixed and it no longer requires specifying `options`.\n  This makes the following configuration valid:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"linter\": {\n      \"rules\": {\n        \"style\": {\n          \"noDefaultExport\": {\n            \"level\": \"off\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n### Editors\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Biome extension is now able to parse the JSX syntax in files that associated with the `javascript` [language identifier](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentItem). This is an ad hoc fix, because [in the React world, `.js` files are allowed to include JSX syntax](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/87#issuecomment-234627904), and these files are often associated with the `javascript` language identifier in most of the editors. Plus, [some editor extensions](https://github.com/michaelgmcd/vscode-language-babel/blob/8b3a472748ad07c99dc022b66795c9eb46be4ccb/package.json#L63-L80) will also associate `.jsx` files with the `javascript` language identifier.

Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#2291](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2291) by correctly handle comment placement for JSX spread attributes and JSX spread children. Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n### Linter\n\n#### Promoted rules\n\nNew rules are incubated in the nursery group.\nOnce stable, we promote them to a stable group.\nThe following rules are promoted:\n\n- [complecity/noExcessiveNestedTestSuites](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-excessive-nested-test-suites)\n- [complexity/noUselessTernary](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-ternary)\n- [correctness/useJsxKeyInIterable](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-jsx-key-in-iterable)\n- [performance/noBarrelFile](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-barrel-file/)\n- [performance/noReExportAll](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-re-export-all/)\n- [style/noNamespaceImport](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-namespace-import/)\n- [style/useNodeAssertStrict](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-node-assert-strict/)\n- [suspicious/noDuplicateTestHooks](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-test-hooks/)\n- [suspicious/noExportsInTest](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-exports-in-test/)\n- [suspicious/noFocusedTests](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-focused-tests/)\n- [suspicious/noSkippedTests](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-skipped-tests/)\n- [suspicious/noSuspiciousSemicolonInJsx](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-suspicious-semicolon-in-jsx)\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add a new option `jsxRuntime` to the `javascript` configuration. When set to `reactClassic`, the [noUnusedImports](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-imports) and [useImportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-type) rules use this information to make exceptions for the React global that is required by the React Classic JSX transform.\n\n  This is only necessary for React users who haven't upgraded to the [new JSX transform](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos and @arendjr\n\n- Implement [#2043](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2043): The React rule [`useExhaustiveDependencies`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/) is now also compatible with Preact hooks imported from `preact/hooks` or `preact/compat`. Contributed by @arendjr\n\n- Add rule [noFlatMapIdentity](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-flat-map-identity) to disallow unnecessary callback use on `flatMap`. Contributed by @isnakode\n\n- Add rule [noConstantMathMinMaxClamp](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-constant-math-min-max-clamp), which disallows using `Math.min` and `Math.max` to clamp a value where the result itself is constant. Contributed by @mgomulak\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- [style/useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention/) now allows prefixing a filename with `+` ([#2341](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2341)).\n\n  This is a convention used by [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page) and [Vike](https://vike.dev/route).\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [style/useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) now accepts `PascalCase` for local and top-level variables.\n\n  This allows supporting local variables that hold a component or a regular class.\n  The following code is now accepted:\n\n  ```tsx\n  function loadComponent() {\n    const Component = getComponent();\n    return <Component />;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [complexity/useLiteralKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-literal-keys/) no longer report computed properties named `__proto__` ([#2430](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2430)).\n\n  In JavaScript, `{[\"__proto__\"]: null}` and `{__proto__: null}` have not the same semantic.\n  The first code set a regular property to `null`.\n  The second one set the prototype of the object to `null`.\n  See the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto) for more details.\n\n  The rule now ignores computed properties named `__proto__`.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Lint rules `useNodejsImportProtocol`, `useNodeAssertStrict`, `noRestrictedImports`, `noNodejsModules` will no longer check `declare module` statements anymore. Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- [style/useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) now accepts any case for variables from object destructuring ([#2332](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2332)).\n\n  The following name is now ignored:\n\n  ```js\n  const { Strange_Style } = obj;\n  ```\n\n  Previously, the rule renamed this variable. This led to a runtime error.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n### Parser\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue when Unicode surrogate pairs were encoded in JavaScript strings\n  using an escape sequence ([#2384](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2384)).\n  Contributed by @arendjr\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n* chore: derive `Diagnostic` on `enum` by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2282\n* feat(css_formatter): ValueListLayout::SingleLine by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2226\n* Describe multi-root workspace limitation in docs by @smikitky in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2297\n* refactor(project): new crate biome_configuration by @unvalley in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2269\n* refactor(biome_deserialize): replace `is_type()` with `visitable_type()` by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2310\n* feat: graphql lexer by @vohoanglong0107 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2271\n* docs: add warning around nested config by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2318\n* feat(cli): generic reporter APIs by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/853\n* fix(js_analyzer): add graphics-symbol role by @drwpow in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2294\n* fix(lint): `noSvgWithoutTitle` valid case to use `aria-hidden` correctly by @unvalley in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2340\n* fix(lint/useExhaustiveDependencies): unintended application of stable custom hook rules by @fluffy-takagi in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2328\n* refactor(linter): allow multiple rule sources by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2336\n* chore(use-number-namespace.md): fix typo by @arienshibani in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2155\n* docs(website): Getting Started and Formatter improvements by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2379\n* chore(website): add `yaml` & `graphql` to language support & sync table rows by @afonsojramos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2363\n* docs: fix the broken link in analyzer/index.mdx by @ganta in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2400\n* feat(biome_css_analyze): implement `noDuplicateFontNames` by @togami2864 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2308\n* chore: add Grit patterns crate by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2275\n* docs: update useForOf to include a relevant example by @DeJayDev in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2429\n* chore(benchmark): update eslint to v9 by @chansuke in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2431\n* fix: update the extension in the code block of the docs by @togami2864 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2436\n* docs: suggest biome migrate commands after biome init by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2437\n* docs(useImportType): add caveat section by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2444\n* refactor(codegen): reduce Git conflicts using slices instead of arrays by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2446\n* chore(deps): update rust crate insta to 1.38.0 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2451\n* chore(deps): update pnpm to v8.15.7 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2449\n* chore(deps): update @biomejs packages by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2448\n* chore(deps): update rust crate quote to 1.0.36 by @renovate in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2450\n* chore: update xtask/bench readme by @mdm317 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2423\n\n## New Contributors\n* @smikitky made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2297\n* @castarco made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2319\n* @drwpow made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2294\n* @github-actions made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2334\n* @fluffy-takagi made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2328\n* @arienshibani made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2155\n* @afonsojramos made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2363\n* @ganta made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2400\n* @DeJayDev made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2429\n* @mgomulak made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2404\n* @isnakode made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2324\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/cli/v1.6.4...cli/v1.7.0",

Biome is now able to correctly find the `biome.jsonc` configuration file when `--config-path` is explicitly set ([#2164](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2164)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- JavaScript/TypeScript files of different variants (`.ts`, `.js`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`) in a single workspace now have stable formatting behaviors when running the CLI command in paths of different nested levels or in different operating systems ([#2080](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2080), [#2109](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2109)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Complete the documentation and overrides support for options `formatter.lineEnding`, `[language].formatter.lineEnding`, `formatter.attributePosition` and `javascript.formatter.attributePosition`.

Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n### Linter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add rule [noEvolvingAny](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-evolving-any) to disallow variables from evolving into `any` type through reassignments. Contributed by @fujiyamaorange\n\n### LSP\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Quickfix action no longer autofixes lint rule errors on save when `linter` is disabled ([#2161](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2161)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n- Range formatting for Astro/Svelte/Vue doesn't place code out of place, especially when formatting on paste is enabled. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Parser\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n* feat(parser): GritQL parser by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1998\n* chore: reduce redundant lexer methods by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2165\n* chore(ci): update `setup-rust` cache strategy by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2166\n* chore(ci): do not cache nightly channel by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2167\n* chore(ci): revert `wasm-pack` dev mode change by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2170\n* fix(website): control flow by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2174\n* feat(css_formatter): CssPropertyAtRule formatting by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2181\n* feat(css_formatter): CssNamespaceAtRule formatting by @denbezrukov in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2182\n* docs(guides/how-biome-works): remove dangling phrase by @marcalexiei in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2179\n* fix(website): a small typo by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2192\n* fix(codegen): new lint rule generation by @unvalley in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2187\n* docs(website): translate integrate-biome-with-your-vcs into Japanese by @unvalley in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2176\n\n## New Contributors\n* @marcalexiei made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2179\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/cli/v1.6.2...cli/v1.6.3",

Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Fix discrepancies on file source detection. Allow module syntax in `.cts` files ([#2114](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2114)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### CLI\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixes [#2131](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2131), where folders were incorrectly ignored when running the command `check`. Now folders are correctly ignored based on their command. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Smoother handling of `\"endOfLine\": \"auto\"` in prettier migration: falling back to `\"lf\"` ([#2145](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2145)). Contributed by @eMerzh\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix enabled rules calculation. The precendence of individual rules, `all` and `recommend` presets in top-level and group-level configs is now correctly respected. More details can be seen in ([#2072](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2072)) ([#2028](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2028)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#1661](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1661). Now nested conditionals are aligned with Prettier's logic, and won't contain mixed spaces and tabs. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Support applying lint fixes when calling the `lintContent` method of the `Biome` class ([#1956](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1956)). Contributed by @mnahkies\n\n### Linter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Rule `noUndeclaredDependencies` now also validates `peerDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` ([#2122](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2122)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Rule `noUndeclaredDependencies` won't check `declare module` statements anymore ([#2123](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2123)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Fix [#1925](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1925). The fix for `useOptionalChain` would sometimes suggest an incorrect fix that discarded optional chaining operators on the left-hand side of logical expressions. These are now preserved. Contributed by @arendjr\n\n- Rule `noUndeclaredVariables` now also checks for worker globals ([#2121](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2121)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### LSP\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Correctly parse `.jsonc` files. Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Correctly resolve external `extends` configs. Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/js-api/v0.5.0...cli/v1.6.2",

Contributed by @Sec-ant\n- Fix a false positive where some files were counted as \"fixed\" even though they weren't modified. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- `json.formatter.trailingCommas` option now works in `overrides` ([#2009](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2009)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Linter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add rule [noDoneCallback](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-done-callback), this rule checks the function parameter of hooks & tests\n  for use of the done argument, suggesting you return a promise instead. Contributed by @vasucp1207\n\n  ```js\n  beforeEach(done => {\n    // ...\n  });\n  ```\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- [useJsxKeyInIterable](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-jsx-key-in-iterable) now recognizes function bodies wrapped in parentheses ([#2011](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2011)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- [useShorthandFunctionType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-function-type) now preserves type parameters of generic interfaces when applying fixes ([#2015](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2015)). Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n- Code fixes of [useImportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-type) and [useExportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-export-type) now handle multiline statements ([#2041](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2041)). Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) no longer reports type parameter and parameter with identical names ([#1992](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1992)).\n\n  The following code is no longer reported:\n\n  ```ts\n  function f<a>(a: a) {}\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) now reports duplicate type parameters in a same declaration.\n\n  The following type parameters are now reported as a redeclaraion:\n\n  ```ts\n  function f<T, T>() {}\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [noUndeclaredDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-dependencies/) now recognizes imports of subpath exports.\n\n  E.g., the following import statements no longer report errors if `@mui/material` and `tailwindcss` are installed as dependencies:\n\n  ```ts\n  import Button from \"@mui/material/Button\";\n  import { fontFamily } from \"tailwindcss/defaultTheme\";\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n### Parser\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- JavaScript lexer is now able to lex regular expression literals with escaped non-ascii chars ([#1941](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1941)).\n\n  Contributed by @Sec-ant\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Other changes\n* fix: concurrency deadlock by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1980\n* Add GritQL grammar by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1951\n* fix: website favicon by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1989\n* feat(cli): add `--stdio` argument to `lsp-proxy` command by @nhedger in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1997\n* release: update crates by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2002\n* docs(website): remove nightly extension by @SuperchupuDev in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2018\n* fix(`useShorthandFunctionType`): generic interface type parameters by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2020\n* fix(playground): fix `bracketSameLine` default by @SuperchupuDev in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2021\n* fix(supicious/noDoubleEquals): fix typo by @Kenzo-Wada in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2006\n* chore: remove repetitive words by @pengqiseven in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2019\n* chore: update js-api snapshot by @togami2864 in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2024\n* docs: add description of exception for index usage by @chansuke in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2023\n* feat(biome_js_analyze): update the methods of `noFocusedTests` by @chansuke in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1999\n* chore: review contribution document by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2034\n* docs: language creation by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2042\n* Enable extra-traits feature in syn by @arendjr in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2049\n* release: crates by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2050\n* release: crates by @ematipico in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2055\n* chore: remove unused deps by @Conaclos in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2053\n* fix(website): result tab panel height by @Sec-ant in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2057\n\n## New Contributors\n* @Kenzo-Wada made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2006\n* @pengqiseven made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2019\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/cli/v1.5.3-nightly.4fa841c...cli/v1.6.1",

Contributed\n  by @ematipico\n\n  ```diff\n  ---\n  - import { getLocale } from \"astro:i18n\";\n  - import { Code } from \"astro:components\";\n  + import { Code } from \"astro:components\";\n  + import { getLocale } from \"astro:i18n\";\n  ---\n\n  <div></div>\n  ```\n- Add partial for `.vue` files. Biome is able to sort imports inside the script block of Vue files. Contributed by\n  @nhedger\n\n  ```diff\n  <script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  - import Button from \"./components/Button.vue\";\n  - import * as vueUse from \"vue-use\";\n  + import * as vueUse from \"vue-use\";\n  + import Button from \"./components/Button.vue\";\n  </script/>\n\n  <template></template>\n  ```\n\n- Add partial for `.svelte` files. Biome is able to sort imports inside the script block of Svelte files. Contributed by\n  @ematipico\n\n  ```diff\n  <script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  - import Button from \"./components/Button.svelte\";\n  - import * as svelteUse from \"svelte-use\";\n  + import * as svelteUse from \"svelte-use\";\n  + import Button from \"./components/Button.svelte\";\n  </script/>\n\n  <div></div>\n  ```\n\n- Add lint rule useJsxKeyInIterable from Eslint rule [`react/jsx-key`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-key.md). Contributed by @vohoanglong0107\n- The analyzer now **infers** the correct quote from `javascript.formatter.quoteStyle`, if set. This means that code fixes suggested by the analyzer will use the same quote of the formatter. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables) ignores unused rest spread silbings.\n\n  The following code is now valid:\n\n  ```js\n  const { a, ...rest } = { a: 0, b: 1 };\n  console.log(rest);\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n- Fix [#1931](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1931). Built-in React hooks such as\n  `useEffect()` can now be validated by the\n  [`useExhaustiveDependendies`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/), even\n  when they're not being imported from the React library. To do so, simply configure them like\n  any other user-provided hooks.\n\n  Contributed by @arendjr\n\n- Implemented [#1128](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1128). User-provided React hooks can\n  now be configured to track stable results. For example:\n\n  ```json\n  \"useExhaustiveDependencies\": {\n      \"level\": \"error\",\n      \"options\": {\n          \"hooks\": [{\n              \"name\": \"useMyState\",\n              \"stableResult\": [\n                  1\n              ]\n          }]\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This will allow the following to be validated:\n\n  ```js\n  const [myState, setMyState] = useMyState();\n  const toggleMyState = useCallback(() => {\n    setMyState(!myState);\n  }, [myState]); // Only `myState` needs to be specified here.\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @arendjr\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#1748](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1748). Now for the following case we won't provide an unsafe fix\n  for the `noNonNullAssertion` rule:\n\n  ```ts\n  x[y.z!];\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n- Imports that contain the protocol `:` are now sorted after the `npm:` modules, and before the `URL` modules.\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n  ```diff\n  import express from \"npm:express\";\n  - import Component from \"./component.js\"\n  - import { sortBy } from \"virtual:utils\";\n  + import { sortBy } from \"virtual:utils\";\n  + import Component from \"./component.js\"\n  ```\n\n- Fix [#1081](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1081). The `useAwait` rule does not report `for await...of`.\n  Contributed by @unvalley\n\n- Fix [#1827](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1827) by properly analyzing nested `try-finally` statements. Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n- Fix [#1924](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1924) Use the correct export name to sort in the import clause. Contributed by @ah-yu\n- Fix [#1805](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1805) fix formatting arrow function which has conditional expression body  Contributed by @mdm317\n\n- Fix [#1781](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1781) by avoiding the retrieval of the entire static member expression for the reference if the static member expression does not start with the reference. Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n### CLI\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add a new command `biome migrate prettier`. The command will read the file `.prettierrc`/`prettier.json`\n  and `.prettierignore` and map its configuration to Biome's one.\n  Due to the different nature of `.prettierignore` globs and Biome's globs, it's **highly** advised to make sure that\n  those still work under Biome.\n\n- Now the file name printed in the diagnostics is clickable. If you run the CLI from your editor, you can <kbd>\n  Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title=\"Cmd\">⌘</kbd> + Click on the file name, and the editor will open said file. If row and columns\n  are specified e.g. `file.js:32:7`, the editor will set the cursor right in that position. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add an option `--linter` to `biome rage`. The option needs to check Biome linter configuration. Contributed by\n  @seitarof\n\n- Add an option `--formatter` to `biome rage`. The option needs to check Biome formatter configuration. Contributed by\n  @seitarof\n- The CLI now consistently reports the number of files tha were changed, out of the total files that were analysed. Contributed by @ematipico\n- The CLI now consistently shows the number of errors and warnings emitted. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Don't process files under an ignored directory.\n\n  Previously, Biome processed all files in the traversed hierarchy,\n  even the files under an ignored directory.\n  Now, it completely skips the content of ignored directories.\n\n  For now, directories cannot be ignored using `files.include` in the configuration file.\n  This is a known limitation that we want to address in a future release.\n\n  For instance, if you have a project with a folder `src` and a folder `test`,\n  the following configuration doesn't completely ignore `test`.\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"files\": {\n      \"include\": [\"src\"]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Biome will traverse `test`,\n  however all files of the directory are correctly ignored.\n  This can result in file system errors,\n  if Biome encounters dangling symbolic links or files with higher permissions.\n\n  To avoid traversing the `test` directory,\n  you should ignore the directory using `ignore`:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"files\": {\n      \"include\": [\"src\"],\n      \"ignore\": [\"test\"]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Fix [#1508](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1508) by excluding deleted files from being processed. Contributed\n  by @ematipico\n\n- Fix [#1173](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1173). Fix the formatting of a single instruction with commented\n  in a control flow body to ensure consistency. Contributed by @mdm317\n\n- Fix overriding of `javascript.globals`. Contributed by @arendjr\n- Fix a bug where syntax rules weren't run when pulling the diagnostics. Now Biome will emit more parsing diagnostics,\n  e.g.\n  ```\n  check.js:1:17 parse/noDuplicatePrivateClassMembers ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n    × Duplicate private class member \"#foo\"\n\n    > 1 │ class A { #foo; #foo }\n        │                 ^^^^\n\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n- Fix [#1774](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1774) by taking into account the option `--no-errors-on-unmatched` when running the CLI using `--changed`. Contributed by @antogyn\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- Removed a superfluous diagnostic that was printed during the linting/check phase of a file:\n\n  ```\n  test.js check ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n    × The file contains diagnostics that needs to be addressed.\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n- The command `format` now emits parsing diagnostics if there are any, and it will terminate with a non-zero exit code. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add the ability to resolve the configuration files defined inside `extends` from the `node_modules/` directory.\n\n  If you want to resolve a configuration file that matches the specifier `@org/configs/biome`, then your `package.json`\n  file must look this:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"name\": \"@org/configs\",\n    \"exports\": {\n      \"./biome\": \"./biome.json\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  And the `biome.json` file that \"imports\" said configuration, will look like this:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"extends\": \"@org/configs/biome\"\n  }\n  ```\n  Read the [documentation](https://biomejs.dev/guides/how-biome-works#the-extends-option) to better understand how it\n  works, expectations and restrictions.\n\n### Editors\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix a regression where ignored files where formatted in the editor. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Fix a bug where syntax rules weren't run when pulling the diagnostics. Now Biome will emit more parsing diagnostics,\n  e.g.\n  ```\n  check.js:1:17 parse/noDuplicatePrivateClassMembers ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n    × Duplicate private class member \"#foo\"\n\n    > 1 │ class A { #foo; #foo }\n        │                 ^^^^\n\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### New features\n\n- Biome now allows to format the `package.json` file. This is now the default behaviour and users can remove their\n  workarounds.\n  If you rely on other tools to format `package.json`, you'll have to ignore it via configuration. Contributed by\n  @pattrickrice\n- New formatter option `attributePosition` that have similar behavior as\n  Prettier `singleAttributePerLine` [#1706](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1706). Contributed by @octoshikari\n- Add partial for `.astro` files. Biome is able to format the frontmatter of the Astro files. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n  ```diff\n  ---\n  - statement ( );\n  + statement();\n  ---\n\n  <div></div>\n  ```\n- Add partial for `.vue` files. Biome is able to format the script block of Vue files. Contributed by @nhedger\n\n  ```diff\n  <script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  - statement ( );\n  + statement();\n  </script/>\n\n  <template></template>\n  ```\n\n- Add partial for `.svelte` files. Biome is able to format the script block of Svelte files. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n  ```diff\n  <script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  - statement ( );\n  + statement();\n  </script/>\n\n  <div></div>\n  ```\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n- `composer.json`, `deno.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` are no longer protected files.\n\n  This means that you can now format them.\n\n  If you want to ignore these files, you can use the [files.ignore](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesignore) configuration:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"files\": {\n      \"ignore\": [\n        \"composer.json\",\n        \"jsconfig.json\",\n        \"package.json\",\n        \"tsconfig.json\",\n        \"typescript.json\",\n        \"deno.json\",\n        \"deno.jsonc\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The following files are still protected, and thus ignored:\n\n  - `composer.lock`\n  - `npm-shrinkwrap.json`\n  - `package-lock.json`\n  - `yarn.lock`\n\n   Contributed by @pattrickrice and @Conaclos\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#1039](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1039). Check unicode width instead of number of bytes when\n  checking if regex expression is a simple argument.\n\n  This no longer breaks.\n\n  ```js\n  s(/🚀🚀/).s().s();\n  ```\n\n   Contributed by @kalleep\n\n- Fix [#1218](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1218), by correctly preserving empty lines in member chains.\n  Contributed by @ah-yu\n- Fix [#1659](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1659) and [#1662](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1662), by correctly taking into account the leading comma inside the formatter options. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Fix [#1934](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1934). Fix invalid formatting of long arrow function for AsNeeded arrow parens Contributed by @fireairforce\n\n### JavaScript APIs\n\n### Linter\n\n#### Promoted rules\n\nNew rules are incubated in the nursery group.\nOnce stable, we promote them to a stable group.\nThe following rules are promoted:\n\n- [complexity/noEmptyTypeParameters](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-empty-type-parameters)\n- [complexity/noUselessLoneBlockStatements](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-lone-block-statements)\n- [correctness/noInvalidUseBeforeDeclaration](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-invalid-use-before-declaration)\n- [correctness/noUnusedImports](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-imports)\n- [correctness/noUnusedPrivateClassMembers](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-private-class-members)\n- [security/noGlobalEval](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-eval)\n- [style/useConsistentArrayType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-consistent-array-type)\n- [style/useExportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-export-type)\n- [style/useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention)\n- [style/useForOf](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-for-of)\n- [style/useImportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-type)\n- [style/useNodejsImportProtocol](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-nodejs-import-protocol)\n- [style/useNumberNamespace](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-number-namespace)\n- [style/useShorthandFunctionType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-function-type)\n- [suspicious/noEmptyBlockStatements](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-empty-block-statements)\n- [suspicious/noGlobalAssign](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-assign)\n- [suspicious/noMisleadingCharacterClass](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-misleading-character-class)\n- [suspicious/noThenProperty](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-then-property)\n- [suspicious/useAwait](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-await)\n\nAdditionally, the following rules are now recommended:\n\n- [suspicious/noApproximativeNumericConstant](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-approximative-numeric-constant)\n- [suspicious/noMisrefactoredShorthandAssign](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-misrefactored-shorthand-assign)\n\n#### Removed rules\n\n- Remove `nursery/useGroupedTypeImport`. The rule [style/useImportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-type) covers the behavior of this rule.\n\n  Note that removing a nursery rule is not considered a breaking change according to our [semantic versioning](https://biomejs.dev/internals/versioning).\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n#### New features\n\n- Add the rule [noSkippedTests](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-skipped-tests), to disallow skipped tests:\n\n  ```js\n  describe.skip(\"test\", () => {});\n  it.skip(\"test\", () => {});\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add the rule [noFocusedTests](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-focused-tests), to disallow skipped tests:\n\n  ```js\n  describe.only(\"test\", () => {});\n  it.only(\"test\", () => {});\n  ```\n  Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Add rule [useSortedClasses](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-sorted-classes), to sort CSS utility classes:\n\n  ```diff\n  - <div class=\"px-2 foo p-4 bar\" />\n  + <div class=\"foo·bar·p-4·px-2\" />\n  ```\n  Contributed by @DaniGuardiola\n\n- Add rule [noUndeclaredependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-dependencies), to detect the use of\n  dependencies that aren't present in the `package.json`.\n\n  The rule ignores imports using a protocol such as `node:`, `bun:`, `jsr:`, `https:`.\n\n  Contributed by @ematipico and @Conaclos\n\n- Add rule [noNamespaceImport](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-namespace-import), to report namespace imports:\n\n  ```js\n  import * as foo from \"foo\";\n  ```\n  Contributed by @unvalley\n- Add partial support for `.astro` files.

Contributed by @nhedger\n\n- Fix [#1589](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1589). Fix invalid formatting of own line comments when they were at the end of an import/export list. Contributed by @spanishpear\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Override correctly the recommended preset ([#1349](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1349)).\n\n  Previously, if unspecified, Biome turned on the recommended preset in overrides.\n  This resulted in reporting diagnostics with a severity level set to `off`.\n  This in turn caused Biome to fail.\n\n  Now Biome won't switch on the recommended preset in `overrides` unless told to do so.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Don't format **ignored** files that are well-known JSONC files when `files.ignoreUnknown` is enabled ([#1607](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1607)).\n\n  Previously, Biome always formatted files that are known to be JSONC files (e.g. `.eslintrc`) when `files.ignoreUnknown` was enabled.\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n### Formatter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#1178](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1178), where the line ending option wasn't correctly applied. Contributed by @ematipico\n- Fix [#1571](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1571). Fix invalid formatting of nested multiline comments. Contributed by @ah-yu\n\n### Linter\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix [#1575](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1575). [noArrayIndexKey](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-array-index-key/) now captures array index value inside template literals and with string concatination. Contributed by @vasucp1207\n\n- Linter rules that inspect regexes now handle multibyte characters correctly ([#1522](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1522)).\n\n  Previously, [noMisleadingCharacterClass](https://biomejs.dev/linter/no-misleading-character-class), [noMultipleSpacesInRegularExpressionLiterals](https://biomejs.dev/linter/no-multiple-spaces-in-regular-expression-literals), and [noEmptyCharacterClassInRegex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/no-empty-character-class-in-regex) made Biome errors on multi-bytes characters.\n  Multibyte characters are now handled correctly.\n\n  The following code no longer raises an internal error:\n\n  ```js\n  // Cyrillic characters\n  /[\\u200E\\u2066-\\u2069]/gu;\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/use-exhaustive-dependencies) no longer made Biome errors in code TypeScript import equal declarations ([#1194](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1194)). Contributed by @Conaclos\n\n- Fix typo in the diagnostic of [noNodejsModules](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-nodejs-modules). Contributed by @huseeiin\n\n### Parser\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- Accept the `const` modifier for type parameter in method type signature ([#1624](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1624)).\n\n  The following code is now correctly parsed:\n\n  ```ts\n  type Foo = {\n    <const T>();\n    method<const T>();\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Contributed by @magic-akari\n\n### Website\n\n#### New\n\n- Add a [page that maps the Biome rule to its source](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules-sources/). Contributed by @ematipico\n\n#### Fixes\n\n- Generate Open Graph images based on the linked page. Contributed by @ematipico\n\n- Fix examples of the [git hook page](https://biomejs.dev/recipes/git-hooks/). Contributed by @9renpoto, @lmauromb, and @Conaclos\n\n- Fix dead and erroneous hyperlinks. Contributed by @Sec-ant and Conaclos\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at main -->\n\n\n## New Contributors\n* @SpanishPear made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1604\n* @9renpoto made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1612\n* @huseeiin made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1621\n* @Sec-ant made their first contribution in https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1632\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/compare/cli/v1.5.2-nightly.91c7730...cli/v1.5.3",

    "body": "\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1512](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1512) by skipping verbose diagnostics from the count. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n- Correctly handle cascading `include` and `ignore`.\r\n\r\n  Previously Biome incorrectly included files that were included at tool level and ignored at global level.\r\n  In the following example, `file.js` was formatted when it should have been ignored.\r\n  Now, Biome correctly ignores the directory `./src/sub/`.\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  ❯ tree src\r\n    src\r\n    └── sub\r\n        └── file.js\r\n\r\n  ❯ cat biome.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"files\": { \"ignore\": [\"./src/sub/\"] },\r\n      \"formatter\": { \"include\": [\"./src\"] }\r\n    }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Don't emit verbose warnings when a protected file is ignored.\r\n\r\n  Some files, such as `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`, are [protected](https://biomejs.dev/guides/how-biome-works/#protected-files).\r\n  Biome emits a verbose warning when it encounters a protected file.\r\n\r\n  Previously, Biome emitted this verbose warning even if the file was ignored by the configuration.\r\n  Now, it doesn't emit verbose warnings for protected files that are ignored.\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- `overrides` no longer affect which files are ignored. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- The file `biome.json` can't be ignored anymore. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1541](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1541) where the content of protected files wasn't returned to `stdout`. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n- Don't handle CSS files, the formatter isn't ready yet. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [1440](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1440), a case where `extends` and `overrides` weren't correctly emitting the final configuration. Contributed by @arendjr\r\n\r\n- Correctly handle `include` when `ignore` is set (#1468). Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  Previously, Biome ignored `include` if `ignore` was set.\r\n  Now, Biome check both `include` and `ignore`.\r\n  A file is processed if it is included and not ignored.\r\n  If `include` is not set all files are considered included.\r\n\r\n### Formatter\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix placement of comments before `*` token in generator methods with decorators. [#1537](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1537) Contributed by @ah-yu\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1406](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1406). Ensure comments before the `async` keyword are placed before it. Contributed by @ah-yu\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1172](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1172). Fix placement of line comment after function expression parentheses, they are now attached to first statement in body. Contributed by @kalleep\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1511](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1511) that made the JavaScript formatter crash. Contributed @Conaclos\r\n\r\n### Linter\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Add an unsafe code fix for [noConsoleLog](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-console-log/). Contributed by @vasucp1207\r\n\r\n- [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function) no longer reports function in `extends` clauses or in a `new` expression. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  This cases requires the presence of a prototype.\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- The fix of [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function) now adds parentheses around the arrow function in more cases where it is needed ([#1524](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1524)).\r\n\r\n  A function expression doesn't need parentheses in most expressions where it can appear.\r\n  This is not the case with the arrow function.\r\n  We previously added parentheses when the function appears in a call or member expression.\r\n  We now add parentheses in binary-like expressions and other cases where they are needed, hopefully covering all cases.\r\n\r\n  Previously:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - f = f ?? function() {};\r\n  + f = f ?? () => {};\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Now:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - f = f ?? function() {};\r\n  + f = f ?? (() => {});\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1514](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1514). Fix autofix suggestion to avoid the syntax error in `no_useless_fragments`.

[#1449](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1449) Contributed by @faultyserver\r\n\r\n### Linter\r\n\r\n#### Promoted rules\r\n\r\nNew rules are incubated in the nursery group.\r\nOnce stable, we promote them to a stable group.\r\nThe following rules are promoted:\r\n\r\n- [a11y/noAriaHiddenOnFocusable](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-aria-hidden-on-focusable)\r\n- [a11y/useValidAriaRole](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-valid-aria-role)\r\n- [complexity/useRegexLiterals](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-regex-literals)\r\n- [suspicious/noImplicitAnyLet](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-implicit-any-let)\r\n- [style/noDefaultExport](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-default-export)\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n- Add [useExportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-export-type) that enforces the use of type-only exports for types. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n    interface A {}\r\n    interface B {}\r\n    class C {}\r\n\r\n  - export type { A, C }\r\n  + export { type A, C }\r\n\r\n  - export { type B }\r\n  + export type { B }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add [useImportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-type) that enforces the use of type-only imports for types. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - import { A, B } from \"./mod.js\";\r\n  + import { type A, B } from \"mod\";\r\n    let a: A;\r\n    const b: B = new B();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Also, the rule groups type-only imports:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - import { type A, type B } from \"./mod.js\";\r\n  + import type { A, B } from \"./mod.js\";\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add [useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention), that enforces naming conventions for JavaScript and TypeScript filenames. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  By default, the rule requires that a filename be in `camelCase`, `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, or matches the name of an `export` in the file.\r\n  The rule provides options to restrict the allowed cases.\r\n\r\n- Add [useNodejsImportProtocol](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-nodejs-import-protocol) that enforces the use of the `node:` protocol when importing _Node.js_ modules. Contributed by @2-NOW, @vasucp1207, and @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - import fs from \"fs\";\r\n  + import fs from \"node:fs\";\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add [useNumberNamespace](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-number-namespace) that enforces the use of the `Number` properties instead of the global ones.\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - parseInt;\r\n  + Number.parseInt;\r\n  - - Infinity;\r\n  + Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add [useShorthandFunctionType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-function-type) that enforces using function types instead of object type with call signatures. Contributed by @emab, @ImBIOS, and @seitarof\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - interface Example {\r\n  -   (): string;\r\n  - }\r\n  + type Example = () => string\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Add [noNodejsModules](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-nodejs-modules), that disallows the use of _Node.js_ modules. Contributed by @anonrig, @ematipico, and @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Add [noInvalidUseBeforeDeclaration](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-invalid-use-before-declaration) that reports variables and function parameters used before their declaration. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  function f() {\r\n    console.log(c); // Use of `c` before its declaration.\r\n    const c = 0;\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add [useConsistentArrayType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-consistent-array-type) that enforces the use of a consistent syntax for array types. Contributed by @eryue0220\r\n\r\n  This rule will replace [useShorthandArrayType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-array-type).\r\n  It provides an option to choose between the shorthand or the generic syntax.\r\n\r\n- Add [noEmptyTypeParameters](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-empty-type-parameters) that ensures that any type parameter list has at least one type parameter. Contributed by @togami2864\r\n\r\n  This will report the following empty type parameter lists:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  interface Foo<> {}\r\n  //           ^^\r\n  type Bar<> = {};\r\n  //      ^^\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add [noGlobalEval](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-eval) that reports any use of the global `eval`.\r\n  Contributed by @you-5805\r\n\r\n- Add [noGlobalAssign](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-assign) that reports assignment to global variables. Contributed by @chansuke\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  Object = {}; // report assignment to `Object`.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add [noMisleadingCharacterClass](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-misleading-character-class) that disallows characters made with multiple code points in character class. Contributed by @togami2864\r\n\r\n- Add [noThenProperty](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-then-property) that disallows the use of `then` as property name. Adding a `then` property makes an object _thenable_ that can lead to errors with Promises. Contributed by @togami2864\r\n\r\n- Add [noUselessTernary](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-ternary) that disallows conditional expressions (ternaries) when simpler alternatives exist.\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  var a = x ? true : true; // this could be simplified to `x`\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- [noEmptyInterface](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-empty-interface) ignores empty interfaces that extend a type. Address [#959](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/959) and [#1157](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1157). Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  This allows supporting interface augmentation in external modules as demonstrated in the following example:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  interface Extension {\r\n    metadata: unknown;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  declare module \"@external/module\" {\r\n    // Empty interface that extends a type.\r\n    export interface ExistingInterface extends Extension {}\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Preserve more comments in the code fix of [useExponentiationOperator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exponentiation-operator). Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  The rule now preserves comments that follow the (optional) trailing comma.\r\n\r\n  For example, the rule now suggests the following code fix:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - Math.pow(\r\n  -    a, // a\r\n  -    2, // 2\r\n  -  );\r\n  +\r\n  +    a ** // a\r\n  +    2 // 2\r\n  +\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- `<svg>` element is now considered as a non-interactive HTML element ([#1095](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1095)). Contributed by @chansuke\r\n\r\n  This affects the following rules:\r\n  - [noAriaHiddenOnFocusable](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-aria-hidden-on-focusable)\r\n  - [noInteractiveElementToNoninteractiveRole](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-interactive-element-to-noninteractive-role)\r\n  - [noNoninteractiveElementToInteractiveRole](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-noninteractive-element-to-interactive-role)\r\n  - [noNoninteractiveTabindex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-noninteractive-tabindex)\r\n  - [useAriaActivedescendantWithTabindex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-aria-activedescendant-with-tabindex)\r\n\r\n- [noMultipleSpacesInRegularExpressionLiterals](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-multiple-spaces-in-regular-expression-literals/) has a safe code fix. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function/) ignores expressions that use `new.target`. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- [noForEach](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-for-each) now reports only calls that use a callback with `0` or `1` parameter. Address [#547](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/547). Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1061](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1061). [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) no longer reports overloads of `export default function`. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  The following code is no longer reported:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  export default function(a: boolean): boolean;\r\n  export default function(a: number): number;\r\n  export default function(a: number | boolean): number | boolean {\r\n  \treturn a;\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix [#651](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/651), [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies) no longer reports out of scope dependencies.

[noUselessElse](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-else) now preserve comments of the `else` clause. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  For example, the rule suggested the following fix:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n    function f(x) {\r\n      if (x <0) {\r\n        return 0;\r\n      }\r\n  -   // Comment\r\n  -   else {\r\n        return x;\r\n  -   }\r\n    }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Now the rule suggests a fix that preserves the comment of the `else` clause:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n    function f(x) {\r\n      if (x <0) {\r\n        return 0;\r\n      }\r\n      // Comment\r\n  -   else {\r\n        return x;\r\n  -   }\r\n    }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1383](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1383). [noConfusingVoidType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-confusing-void-type) now accepts the `void` type in type parameter lists.\r\n\r\n  The rule no longer reports the following code:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  f<void>();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix [#728](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/728). [useSingleVarDeclarator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-single-var-declarator) no longer outputs invalid code. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1167](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1167). [useValidAriaProps](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-valid-aria-props) no longer reports `aria-atomic` as invalid. Contributed by @unvalley\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1192](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1192). [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/) now correctly handles parenthesized expressions and respects type coercions. Contributed by @n-gude\r\n\r\n  These cases are now properly handled:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  \"a\" + (1 + 2) // `a${1 + 2}`\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  1 + (2 + \"a\") // `${1}${2}a`\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1456](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1456). [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/) now reports expressions with an interpolated template literal and non-string expressions. Contributed by @n-gude\r\n\r\n  The following code is now reported:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  `a${1}` + 2;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1436](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1436). [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function/) now applies a correct fix when a function expression is used in a call expression or a member access. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  For example, the rule proposed the following fix:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - const called = function() {}();\r\n  + const called = () => {}();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  It now proposes a fix that adds the needed parentheses:\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  - const called = function() {}();\r\n  + const called = (() => {})();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix [#696](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/696). [useHookAtTopLevel](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-hook-at-top-level) now correctly detects early returns before the calls to the hook.\r\n\r\n- The code fix of [noUselessTypeCOnstraint](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-type-c-onstraint) now adds a trailing comma when needed to disambiguate a type parameter list from a JSX element. COntributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Fix [#578](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/578). [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies) now correctly recognizes hooks namespaced under the `React` namespace.  Contributed by @XiNiHa\r\n\r\n- Fix [#910](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/910). [noSvgWithoutTitle](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-svg-without-title) now ignores `<svg>` element with `aria-hidden=\"true\"`. COntributed by @vasucp1207\r\n\r\n### Parser\r\n\r\n#### BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n- The representation of imports has been simplified. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  The new representation is closer to the ECMAScript standard.\r\n  It provides a single way of representing a namespace import such as `import * as ns from \"\"`.\r\n  It rules out some invalid states that was previously representable.\r\n  For example, it is no longer possible to represent a combined import with a `type` qualifier such as `import type D, { N } from \"\"`.\r\n\r\n  See [#1163](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1163) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n- Imports and exports with both an _import attribute_ and a `type` qualifier are now reported as parse errors.\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  import type A from \"mod\" with { type: \"json\" };\r\n  //     ^^^^              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  //     parse error\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#1077](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1077) where parenthesized identifiers in conditional expression were being parsed as arrow expressions. Contributed by @kalleep\r\n\r\n  These cases are now properly parsed:\r\n\r\n  _JavaScript_:\r\n\r\n  ```javascript\r\n    a ? (b) : a => {};\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  _TypeScript_:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n    a ? (b) : a => {};\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  _JSX_:\r\n\r\n  ```jsx\r\n    bar ? (foo) : (<a>{() => {}}</a>);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Allow empty type parameter lists for interfaces and type aliases ([#1237](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1237)). COntributed by @togami2864\r\n\r\n  _TypeScript_ allows interface declarations and type aliases to have empty type parameter lists.\r\n  Previously Biome didn't handle this edge case.\r\n  Now, it correctly parse this syntax:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  interface Foo<> {}\r\n  type Bar<> = {};\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Crates\r\n\r\n#### BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n- Rename the `biome_js_unicode_table` crate to `biome_unicode_table` ([#1302](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1302)).

    "body": "Biome scores 96% compatibility with Prettier! [Read our announcement on our blog](https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-wins-prettier-challenge).\r\n\r\n### Editors\r\n\r\n- Fix [#933](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/933). Some files are properly ignored in the LSP too. E.g. `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Formatter\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix some accidental line breaks when printing array expressions within arrow functions and other long lines [#917](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/917). Contributed by @faultyserver\r\n\r\n- Match Prettier's breaking strategy for `ArrowChain` layouts [#934](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/934). Contributed by @faultyserver\r\n\r\n- Fix double-printing of leading comments in arrow chain expressions [#951](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/951). Contributed by @faultyserver\r\n\r\n### Linter\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#910](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/910), where the rule `noSvgWithoutTitle` should skip elements that have `aria-hidden` attributes. Contributed by @vasucp1207\r\n\r\n#### Enhancement\r\n\r\n- Implements [#924](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/924) and [#920](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/920). [noUselessElse](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-else) now ignores `else` clauses that follow at least one `if` statement that doesn't break early. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n  For example, the following code is no longer reported by the rule:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  function f(x) {\r\n      if (x < 0) {\r\n        // this `if` doesn't break early.\r\n      } else if (x > 0) {\r\n          return x;\r\n      } else {\r\n          // This `else` block was previously reported as useless.\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#918](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/918), [useSimpleNumberKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-simple-number-keys) no longer repports false positive on comments. Contributed by @kalleep\r\n\r\n- Fix [#953](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/953), [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) no longer reports type parameters with the same name in different mapped types as redeclarations. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Fix [#608](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/608), [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies) no longer repports missing dependencies for React hooks without dependency array.

Now `ignore` and `include` apply or not the override pattern, so they override each other.\r\n  Now the options inside `overrides` override the top-level options.\r\n- Bootstrap the logger only when needed. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n### Editors\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#592](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/592), by changing binary resolution in the IntelliJ plugin. Contributed by @Joshuabaker2\r\n\r\n### Formatter\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Apply the correct layout when the right hand of an assignment expression is a await expression or a yield expression. Contributed by @ematipico\r\n- Fix [#303](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/303), where nested arrow functions didn't break. Contributed by @victor-teles\r\n\r\n### Linter\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix [#175](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/175) which made [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) report index signatures using the name of a variable in the parent scope.\r\n\r\n- Fix [#557](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/557) which made [noUnusedImports](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-imports) report imported types used in `typeof` expression. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n\r\n- Fix [#576](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/576) by removing some erroneous logic in [noSelfAssign](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-self-assign/). Contributed by @ematipico\r\n\r\n- Fix [#595](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/595) by updating unsafe-apply logic to avoid unexpected errors in [noUselessFragments](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-fragments/). Contributed by @nissy-dev\r\n\r\n- Fix [#591](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/591) which made [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) report type parameters with identical names but in different method signatures. Contributed by @Conaclos\r\n- Support more a11y roles and fix some methods for a11y lint rules Contributed @nissy-dev\r\n- Fix `useExhaustiveDependencies`, by removing `useContext`, `useId` and `useSyncExternalStore` from the known hooks.
